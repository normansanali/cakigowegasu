Sue was the cheer coach for the "Cheerios," and one of her missions in life was to get rid of the glee club. Sue infamously wore tracksuits constantly and was typically ruthless, although she had some touching moments from time to time as well. Lynch also appeared on "Criminal Minds" for a handful of episodes, and her role there was a big change of pace from Sue.</p><p>Lynch portrayed Diana Reid, the mother of Dr. Spencer Reid, the main character of the series. According to her <a href=#>IMDb</a> page, Lynch appeared in 10 episodes over the course of the 15-season run of "Criminal Minds." Diana lived with schizophrenia and was cared for in a facility, and she was kidnapped during Season 12 by&nbsp;<a href=#>Cat Adams</a>&nbsp;(who was portrayed by Aubrey Plaza).&nbsp;Diana was remained "unpredictable" throughout her final appearance, per TVLine. Despite her mental health struggles, toward the end of "Criminal Minds" Diana had "some moments of clarity" where she was "able to be a really good Mom to Reid," showrunner Erica Messer told the site. Ultimately, Messer said, "It's a really beautiful way to bring them together." Lynch's roles on "Glee" and "Criminal Minds" might have been essentially opposites of one another, but her fans dearly loved both characters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5nZ4Zze9OhnGafnJqybr%2FTmqlmrJiWwW7Fzq5knaGUo8FuvsSmnKaalad6uK3SZqCnZZOntq61zZqjZqWZo7G0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-best-anime-for-adults.html><span>←</span><span>The 10 best anime series for adults</span></a>
