Lucy Shrimpton, Parenting Expert at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Baby Show</a> and founder of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Sleep Nanny</a>, recently gave her analysis on the star's parenting style to HELLO!, telling us: "Kourtney Kardashian-Barker is a devoted mum, evidently wanting to give her children the very best start in life.
