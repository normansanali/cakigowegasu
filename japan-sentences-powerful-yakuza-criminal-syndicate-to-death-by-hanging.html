The&nbsp;Asahi Shimbun&nbsp;newspaper reports that judge Ben Adachi also sentenced to Nomura’s second-in-command, Fumio Tanoue, 65, to life.

Nomura, “gave an order in the murder case and the other three crimes were carried out under a chain-in-command structure”.</p><p>Those who carried out the attacks have already been convicted, local reports said.</p><p>The first of the four assaults occurred in 1998, the&nbsp;Asahi Shimbun&nbsp;reports: “A former leader of a local fishery cooperative was shot on the streets of Kita-Kyushu. The second occurred in 2012 – a former Fukuoka prefectural police officer was shot in Kita-Kyushu. The third occurred in 2013 in Fukuoka, in which a female nurse at a clinic where Nomura was seeking treatment was stabbed.</p><p>“The fourth took place in 2014, in which a male dentist, who happened to be a relative of the former fishery cooperative leader, was stabbed in Kita-Kyushu.”</p><p>The judge described Nomura’s actions as “extremely vicious”.</p><p>The prosecutors argued Nomura, “deserved the harshest sentence because none of the victims in the four incidents had connections to rival gangs”. They said: “Ordinary citizens became a target in all of the incidents, repeatedly posing a direct threat to society.</p><p>“These incidents were unprecedented in the extremely egregious nature of the crimes carried out by organised gangs.”</p><p>The defence, however, argued Nomura, “had no motivation to attack,” in any of the four cases and he told the court: “I am innocent.”</p><p>Yakuza membership is not illegal in Japan and Yakuza-owned businesses and gang headquarters are often clearly marked.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihmqiRo3q0sc2tnKeblah6sbvWnqmfrZxixqK31LOYZpuinrqqusClZKyxnpm2pK3TnmStp12ZsqLAx2aZsmWYlruotc2gZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jackson-hurst-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jackson Hurst Net Worth</span></a>
