Yes, that sentence exists and so do people who are mad at <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jorts the Cat</a></strong>. Not familiar? You’re about to be.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>Jorts is a pretty plain-looking orange tabby that hit it big back on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> in 2021. A Redditor claimed that Jorts was an office cat and things evolved and Jorts somehow became a supporter of organized labor. Who knows how these things happen.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>Anyway, the internet loves Jorts and several news outlets picked up on the buzzy animal, replete with quotes from the “cat.” Here’s an example of Jorts talking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider</a>: “It’s been really clear how terribly the odds are stacked against the working class, especially in the US. As a worker cat myself, I have solidarity.”</p><p data-characters=40 data-current-count=40 data-injectable=false>And Jorts likes to tweet too, like this:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s against the law for your boss to prohibit you from discussing your wages with your coworkers, and also remember there are more workers than there are bosses <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/d5Ln3h7x6N</a></p>— Jorts (and Jean) (@JortsTheCat) <a href=#>January 2, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>Alright, we’re all caught up. Now because this is the internet and the internet is more fickle than a cat deciding if it wants to come inside or not, things have taken a turn. It all started fairly innocently. A person on Twitter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">talked about</a> a bad experience with a grocery delivery:</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>“My last time using grocery delivery and I got a man, he started refunding stuff that I knew dang on well the store had. I was so pissed I got in the car and went to the store he was at, bruh was literally standing in one aisle on the phone.”</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>This doesn’t seem to be the type of thing that would get Jorts’ interest, but alas, that cat can’t keep its mouth shut apparently. “Idea: Go get your own groceries,” the cat said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Idea:<br>Go get your own groceries</p>— Jorts (and Jean) (@JortsTheCat) <a href=#>October 18, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>So obviously not everyone can get their own groceries. A slight misfire by Jorts but not the end of the world. Someone gave Jorts a chance at redemption by telling him if someone is sick or caring for someone who is they probably can’t leave. For some reason, Jorts doubled down.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>And those folks wouldn’t get in the car and confront a worker being judged by an algorithm for sub minimum wage</p>— Jorts (and Jean) (@JortsTheCat) <a href=#>October 18, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>I get that Jorts is pro-labor so the cat is mad about the woman going after the worker, but that’s not how people took it. The floodgates opened up after that.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>One person said that people who are in need of grocery services to survive should use them, and not listen to a pro-labor cat.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>my fellow chronically ill, disabled, and immunocompromised people trying desperately to survive this fucking hellscape:</p><p>use a grocery delivery service if you need to</p>— Matthew Cortland 👻 (@mattbc) <a href=#>October 18, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=47 data-current-count=47 data-injectable=false>Others pleaded for Jorts to come to his senses.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hey <a href=#>@JortsTheCat</a> the reason many disabled people are calling you out is BECAUSE we love you.

My dude. Remember that time your coworker would butter your fur & keep doors closed in an attempt to get you to live up to Jean’s example?

Jorts was calling out a woman for going to yell at a gig worker but didn’t really make that clear and then made it ten times worse when he doubled down. Will Jorts be able to come back from this and continue to champion the working class? Time will tell.</p><p data-characters=66 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>We’ll keep you posted on this one if anything else develops.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SzprjIp5xmoZ6psrO6xK1knJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKOnoqnAbsDHnmScmaRiwK2tzKacnWWfq7KzecCbo56ho6l6qrrSrZicmaKpeqS7zKacp6yjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carlos-villagran.html><span>←</span><span>Carlos Villagran</span></a>
