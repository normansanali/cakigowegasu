<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Mariah Carey Struggles to Give Jennifer Lopez Standing Ovation on Idol</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Mariah Carey</strong></a>, she could not be moved. When former judge <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> delivered an energetic 10-minute performance on the season finale of American Idol on May 16, Carey kept a fixed smile on her face but did not immedately join the other three judges in giving Lopez a standing ovation. She played with the streamers and grinned straight ahead instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier in the night, Carey took to the stage with a pre-recorded medley of her greatest hits, including "Vision of Love," "Make It Happen," "My All," "Hero," "We Belong Together," and "#Beautiful," but it was Lopez's dance-infused performance that had the audience pumped.</p><p>Lopez gave a rousing rendition of her dance hit "Live It Up," which involved plenty of high-energy moves and an appearance by rapper <strong>Pitbull</strong>. <strong>UPDATE: </strong>Carey's rep explains to <strong>Us </strong>that the singer eventually gave Lopez her due. "Mariah did stand up and gave Jennifer Lopez a standing ovation," says the rep — explaining that the delay was due to a very tight dress. "She was wearing a heavily beaded <strong>Tom Ford </strong>dress that was not easy to maneuver, but she ABSOLUTELY gave JLO a standing ovation."</p><p>The pair have a history of controversy together that dates back to a time when Carey's ex-husband Tommy Mottola gave material she'd selected for her Glitter soundtrack to Lopez after she'd left his label. Lopez, 43, was previously a judge on the hit Fox singing competition, and has been rumored to be returning to the judge's table in an upcoming season as the Fox series struggles in the ratings.</p><p>"I don't know!" Lopez said in response to <a href=#>TV Guide</a>'s question about whether or not she was looking to return. "When I say, 'I don't know,' people think, 'Oh, she's playing a game.' I'm not. If it became really real where I had to make a decision, I would have to sit down and really weigh out the options of what my life looks like in the next year to see if I would sign."</p><p>"Because it does take up a lot of time, and I do have a lot of other things going on that I'm super excited about," she continued. "So we'll see."</p><p>If Lopez does decide to return, however, there's one current judge who would be more than happy for the change.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"All dem #1s but Jlo phone ringin?" <a href=#><strong>Nicki Minaj</strong></a> tweeted on May 2, in a nod to Carey's diss that the "Roman Holiday" rapper had never had a No.1 Billboard hit. "I guess having a personality, being a secure woman, and giving genuine critique still trumps that."</p><p><a href=#>Us Weekly</a> exclusively reported that Minaj is also on her way out after this season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKerql5wpqpnrFdmba0v8SsZKOdnqO2p7HRZqOoqJWverOxxa6qnqtdqbxus8ivnGarpJa7pbXNoGSorpGptrC6jKilZpmdmr%2Bqr8CnZKKcn6F6c3yQbGhwbV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lord-of-the-rings-star-sean-astin-explains-why-peter-jackson-and-elijah-wood-roasted-him.html><span>←</span><span>Lord of the Rings star Sean Astin explains why Peter Jackson and Elijah Wood roasted him</span></a>
