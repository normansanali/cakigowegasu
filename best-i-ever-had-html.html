&#34;You know a lot of girls be thinkin' my songs are about them,
This is not to get confused
This one's for you. &#34;[Bridge:]
Baby, you my everything,
You all I ever wanted.
We could do it real big,
Bigger than you ever done it.
You be up on everything,
Other hoes ain't never on it.
I want this forever,
I swear I could spend whatever On it.
