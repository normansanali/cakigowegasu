The 38-year-old star has been voted by <strong>Us</strong> readers with the most longed-for legs as part of the <a href=# rel=noopener>2nd Annual Hollywood's Hottest Bodies Awards</a>.</p><p><strong>Us</strong> tapped Gold's Gym Trainer Tracy Mallett, author of Sexy in 6 and creator of Booty Barre, for the must-know tips and moves for scoring the star's seriously sexy stems.</p><p><strong>Part 1: Cardio</strong></p><p>Mallett recommends running, spinning, hiking, or swimming 3-5 times a week. "These activities work the legs extensively and help to burn fat so that you can see all the wonderful definition in your legs," says Mallett. "Choose two different types of cardio to keep your lower body challenged."</p><p><strong>Part 2: Circuit Training</strong></p><p>This mix of cardio and strength training is great for blasting flab on the lower body. "Try doing simple jumping jacks for a minute then walking lunges for 2 minutes, and repeat," advises Mallett. "Next do jump squats (squatting low and jumping straight up at the top of the squat) for one minute followed by ski jumps (jumping side to side) for two minutes."</p><p><strong>Part 3: Flexibility and Strength Training</strong></p><p>Yoga and Pilates are Mallett's go-to picks for blending flexibility into a strength-training workout. "It's important to have balance in your lower body workout," says Mallet.&nbsp; "A strong muscle should be flexible, too."</p><p><strong>Part 4: The Right Moves</strong></p><p><strong>The Move: Walking Lunges</strong></p><p><strong>Works</strong>: Glutes, quads and hamstrings</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: "The beauty about these is that you can do them anywhere!" says Mallett.</p><p><strong>Instructions</strong>: Step forward with your right leg and lower your body until your left knee nearly touches the floor. Make sure that your front knee does not pass the tip of your toes. Step forward with your left leg and repeat for the right side.</p><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 3-5 minutes</p><p><strong>The Move: Side-Leg Kicks</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Works</strong>: Glutes and hip flexors<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: <a href=# data-link=1>Posture</a> is key! "Keep your body as straight as possible," says Mallett.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Instructions</strong>: Start by standing sideways and gently hold onto a chair or a counter for support. Internally rotate the outside leg and lift up and down in a slow, controlled movement. For an added challenge, add a few tiny pulses at the top before lowering the leg down.</p><p><strong>Reps</strong>: 30 (15 on each side)</p><p><strong>The Move: Squats</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Works</strong>: Quads<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: "Squats are the perfect exercise to hit all the lower body muscles," says Mallett.</p><p><strong>Instructions</strong>: Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart. Slowly bend at the knees and lower your body as if you're sitting into a chair. Don't let your knees pass over your toes. For an added challenge, add some small pulses at the bottom of your squat — you'll really feel the burn!</p><p><strong>Reps</strong>: 3 sets of 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGahp6diwbB5xp6rZpuRorKzu81mm6KZqqh6rbHAp2SlnZeoenN8kGpvb2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-old-is-sherry-kosnaski-instagram-domain-10-age-wiki-biography-height-boyfriend.html><span>←</span><span>How Old is Sherry Kosnaski?
