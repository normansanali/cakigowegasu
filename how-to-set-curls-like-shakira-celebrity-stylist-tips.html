But now we have the secret to how she gets that enviably perfect curl pattern thanks to a handful of Instagram selfies&nbsp;shared on celebrity stylist Cynthia Alvarez’s feed.</p><p>The She Wolf took&nbsp;a snapshot of her golden coils drying with colored hair clips strategically placed down the length&nbsp;to perfectly set their pattern as they dry. While it was an in-process shot,&nbsp;as Alvarez points out in her caption, the colorful clips also provide a reference to&nbsp;Solange’s iconic imagery with pins&nbsp;in her locks&nbsp;from her song&nbsp;“Don’t Touch My Hair.”</p><p>Another secret: once the curls have dried, Alvarez goes back in with a small curling iron and individually amps up the coils for that iconic Shakira bodacious head of spirals&nbsp;that she can toss around while she performs during her El Dorado World Tour. We know this because Shakira snapped a video of her stylist extraordinaire showing off a peak into their pre-show ritual.</p><p>But with all of the curls and clips, sometimes things fall through the cracks. In a LOL-worthy moment the singer posted a short video clip backstage mid-performance in which the glam duo is laughing because they’ve realized Shakira&nbsp;had an errant setting clip in her hair for the whole performance up to that point. Hey, at least the singer has a sense of humor about it.</p><p>The takeaway: if set your curls like Shakira, just don’t forget to remove all the clips when you’re done!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX528uHnTqGSsnaRisLa%2By6xkpaGbmnq0tMCkoKuZXZiyrbHBq6CtsV2owbq4yKyrZqyZpcBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./post-5412.html><span>←</span><span>GACKT()</span></a>
