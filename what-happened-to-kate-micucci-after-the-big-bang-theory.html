It had everything from <a href=#>memorable characters</a>, to <a href=#>amazing guest stars</a>, and even some <a href=#>ill-advised storylines</a>. The show did everything right, and it was rewarded with a loyal audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kate Micucci was one of the show's many great guest stars, and she had a memorable time on the show. Since then, she has been way busier than some people realize.</p><p>Let's take a look at Kate Micucci's time on the show, and see what she's been up to!</p><h2 id=39-the-big-bang-theory-39-thrived-for-12-seasons>'The Big Bang Theory' Thrived For 12 Seasons</h2><p>Debuting in 2007, and dominating TV well into 2019, The Big Bang Theory is one of the biggest and most successful sitcoms of all time. Love it or hate it, the show was a phenomenon, and its place in TV history is unquestionable.</p><p>The show starred great performers like Kaley Cuoco, Johny Galecki, and Jim Parsons, and its ability to tap into nerd culture was unparalleled. The combination of casting, writing, and subject matter proved to be a perfect storm, and in no time at all, the show was a powerhouse on the small screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At its peak, the series was enjoyed by millions, and it made its stars an unfathomable amount of money in the process.</p><p>Another great element the show had working for it was its ability to find great guest stars, including actress Kate Micucci.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Were Mayim Bialik And Johnny Galecki Feuding On The Big Bang Theory?</a></span></p><h2 id=kate-micucci-made-her-tbbt-debut-in-2013>Kate Micucci Made Her TBBT Debut In 2013</h2><p>Back in 2013, Kate Micucci made her debut as Lucy on The Big Bang Theory, effectively kickstarting what would become a recurring role on the show.</p><p>Turns out, the actress was a fan of the popular sitcom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’ve definitely watched a lot of it. I’ll rewind parts just to see a reaction over and over again. I’m a huge I Love Lucy fan — which is cool because I play character named Lucy — and Big Bang is like that show for me when I rewind to catch certain moments. I was watching the episode where Amy goes to a wedding with Leonard and they’re dancing together, and Amy has the sweetest and cutest reaction to Leonard when they’re doing the chicken dance. I rewound that four times, and I love Mayim Bialik in that and told her as much," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>Her love of the show undoubtedly added to her performance on screen, and she proved herself to be a fantastic addition to the cast while on the show.</p><p>During that same interview, she also spoke on her character's first date with Raj.</p><p>"It’s very sweet, and the library makes sense for a first date for these two. It plays out perfectly — he decides he’d be more comfortable, as she would, too, so we text each other throughout the date. We laughed a lot doing the scene, and it was a fun thing to do in front of a live audience," she added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In total, Micucci's character would last for 8 episodes on the show. Since then, the actress has been relatively busy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mayim Bialik's Big Bang Theory Audition Only Had Five Lines And One Scene</a></span></p><h2 id=kate-micucci-has-kept-active-since-the-big-bang-theory>Kate Micucci Has Kept Active Since The Big Bang Theory</h2><p>Following her final appearance on the show, which was in 2017, Micucci has done a bit of everything.</p><p>On the small screen, she has been on shows like Easy, Will & Grace, Mom, and even Supergirl. These have all been in a much smaller, supporting fashion, but it's great to see the actress getting plenty of opportunities in a wide array of projects. She also recently appeared on Guillermo Del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her film work has been less extensive, but she's done some great stuff. Micucci has been in movies like Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, Flora & Ulysses, and Clerks III. Clearly, she has a great working relationship with Kevin Smith, and we would not be surprised to see her pop up in another one of his movies down the line.</p><p>The actress has also done an extensive amount of voice acting in various projects, even expanding into the world of video games.</p><p>Still not impressed? The actress, who is also an accomplished musician, has also contributed to multiple Steven Universe soundtracks.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Kunal Nayyar Break Character During His 'Whispering' Scenes On The Big Bang Theory?</a></span></p><p>Given her track record, we imagine that Kate Micucci is going to stay busy for years to come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brfArZxmpZmYwqSvyGaYn6yVp3q1tMRmmaKfXZeur7OMrZ%2Bep6KufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlie-colin-train-founding-member-dead-58-freak-accident.html><span>←</span><span>Train founding member Charlie Colin, 58, found dead after freak accident in Brussels</span></a>
