Cody Bellinger Brother- Sister Ashli</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Cody Bellinger’s brother, Cole Bellinger, once dreamt of playing with his brother in the MLB, but that couldn’t come to fruition.</strong></p><p>Cole voluntarily retired from the sport in 2021 after suffering a series of injuries. Their father, Clay Bellinger, is a three-time World Series champion, winning it twice with the Yankees.&nbsp;</p><p>The two brothers also have an older sister named Ashli Korver, who is a former collegiate volleyball player, but quit the sport to focus on her academics.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cody-bellinger-family.jpg><p>The Chicago Cubs star player Cody Bellinger was a star from the day of his debut. The first baseman won NL Rookie of The Year in 2017, and three seasons later, he won the World Series Championship.</p><p>With his former teammates <a href=# rel=noopener>Dustin May</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Blake Treinen</a>, Bellinger lifted the title in 2020 for the Dodgers. Now at Cubs, he is gunning to repeat the feat.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cody Bellinger Brother, Cole Bellinger, Played In The Minor League&nbsp;</h2><p>Cody Bellinger’s brother, Cole Bellinger, was drafted by the San Diego Padres in 2017. He was the 438th overall pick of the draft.</p><p>Born on October 12, 1999, Cole is four years younger than his brother, Cody. A former right-handed pitcher, Cole stands at 6ft 1 inches and played two seasons in the <a href=# rel=noopener>minor league</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, after being drafted by the Padres, Cole was assigned to San Diego Padres Futures, the team in the Arizona Complex League.&nbsp;</p><p>A year later, Cole was assigned to Tri-City Dust Devils, a team in the NWL. He started 12 games for the minor league team scoring eight home runs and averaging .273.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cody-bellinger-brother-cole.jpg><p>But after a few months, Cole was sent back to San Diego Padres Futures in September 2018. The 2018 season also marked the last time Cole played the sport.&nbsp;</p><p>In June 2019, Cole suffered an injury, and after that incident, the talented youngster couldn’t really recover his career. He kept on getting placed on the 60-day injury list, and in 2021, Cole voluntarily retired from the game.&nbsp;</p><p>He is available on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram </a>but has not updated his profile since 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cody Bellinger Sister, Ashli Korver</h2><p>Cody’s sister, Ashli Korver, graduated from Vanguard University with a degree in psychology.&nbsp;</p><p>While at Vanguard, Ashli was also part of the collegiate volleyball team, having previously quit playing soccer. She received a full scholarship ride to Vanguard, having previously played four seasons at her high school.</p><p>But that might have been the end of Ashli’s volleyball career, as she looked to focus on her academics. After completing her studies at Vanguard, Ashli joined Grand Canyon University and earned her M.S. in Professional Counseling.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cody-bellinger-sister-ashli.jpg><p>Ashli has traveled to the African nation Malawi several times and has worked in three local villages. In 2019, she also traveled to Thailand to work with a non-profit organization that combats sex trafficking.&nbsp;</p><p>The older sister of Cody Bellinger is married to Kurtis Korver, who works for Los Angeles Fire Department. The couple started dating in 2018 and tied the knot in 2020.</p><p>The couple became parents for the first time in 2021 as they announced the arrival of their baby girl, Kinsley Elise Korver. Recently, the couple announced they are expecting their second baby girl in November.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCvzp2wZpqVobmqusaeqWaaoqTBqbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./todd-mcgee-obituary-what-was-the-cause-of-his-death-602598-html.html><span>←</span><span>Todd Mcgee Obituary What Was The Cause Of His Death?</span></a>
