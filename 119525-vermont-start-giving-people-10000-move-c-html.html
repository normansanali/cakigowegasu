The reason for their generosity is to attract young people to relocate and start a life for themselves in Vermont.</p><p class=Zg>The average population age in Vermont is 43, almost five years older than the average in the rest of the U.S. and their workforce have dropped by 16,000 in the last nine years.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Source: Freepik</p><p class="Zg _g">Senator Virginia Lyons wrote the bill after being inspired by her son-in-law, who currently lives in Vermont and works from home for an out-of-state company, and</p><p class=Zg>“I was hoping to accomplish a couple of things with this bill.

As odd as it may sound, it is what it is, with the rate of one cow per 3.8 people it has the nations highest ratio of cows to people.</p><p class=Zg>Not like the ‘Green Mountain State’ has billions of people either. The state’s capital, Montpelier, is the smallest state capital in the U.S. with a population of only 7,787 in 2012.</p><p class=Zg>The nickname, ‘Green Mountain State’ derives from the French phrase, ‘vert mont,’ which is also where the state’s name comes from, meaning ‘green mountain.’</p><p class=Zg>The state may be sparsely populated, but it's one of the most progressive. It was first to abolish slavery, grant women partial voting rights and legislate same-sex marriage.</p><p class=Zg>The ‘Remote Worker Grant Program’ may sound like hitting the jackpot for some, but for one that hit an actual jackpot, life changed forever.
