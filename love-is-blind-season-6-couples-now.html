That is the million-dollar question that <a href=#>Netflix’s</a> hit series <a href=#>Love Is Blind</a> has been trying to answer for years now.</p><p>During <a href=#>Season 6</a> of the dating series, which premiered on Feb. 14, 30 singles from the Charlotte, N.C. area hit the pods in hopes of finding their special someone. After 10 days of affectionally talking to the walls, five couples walked out engaged.</p><p>These couples are <a href=#>Amy and Johnny</a>, <a href=#>Kenneth and Brittany</a>, <a href=#>Clay and AD</a>, <a href=#>Chelsea and Jimmy</a>, and <a href=#>Laura and Jeramey</a>. But as all seasoned LIB viewers know, a lot of couples don't end up tying the knot after actually meeting each other IRL. So which Season 6 couples did, and which couples didn't?</p><p>According to marriage records in Mecklenburg County, N.C., Distractify can confirm <strong>that two of the five couples began the marriage license application process during the show, but only one of these couples said "I do."</strong> We can also confirm that the ceremonies took place in May 2023. Keep scrolling for an update on all of the couples and whether or not they walked down the aisle.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Amy and Johnny</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Amy and Johnny take the cake for the most chill couple ever. They were so sweet with one another and caused absolutely zero drama. While Amy did note that she's used to dating "ethnic guys," it seemed pretty clear that Johnny had already stolen her heart and they had truly fallen in love sight unseen. Although, Johnny did seem to come on very strong about his firm desire to start a family later in life, adding extra pressure onto Amy, who isn't on birth control.</p><p>Fortunately, love prevailed! Amy and Johnny got married in Mecklenburg County, N.C. on May 10, 2023, according to public marriage records. Fingers crossed that they'll share all the deets on married life during the Season 6 reunion special.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Kenneth and Brittany</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Kenneth and Brittany quickly connected in the pods over their strong religious beliefs and their interest in education (Brittany is a former teacher and Kenneth is a middle school principal). In fact, the two already started planning out their futures together: They would wait until marriage to have sex and would have at least two kids, ideally twins.</p><p>But outside the pods, their romance seemed to fizzle out fast. In Episode 8, Kenneth seemingly dumped Brittany and moved out of their shared apartment.</p><p>That said, Kenneth and Brittany never began the marriage application process according to public county records.</p><p>Interestingly enough though, Kenneth's name does have an entry listed in marriage index. He is believed to have said "I do" once before in 2018 to a woman named Charleen Vivian Bryant. It's unclear when and if they ever got divorced, though, which definitely makes us have a lot of questions.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">AD and Clay</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Upon meeting each other in person for the first time, Clay and AD were both over the moon with the other's appearance, and their chemistry was undeniable. But once they jetted off to Punta Canta, Clay made some ignorant comments to AD about her diet, body, and how he would still expect her to be the hitting the gym if she was pregnant.</p><p>According to marriage records in Mecklenburg County, N.C., AD and Clay started the marriage application process in early May 2023. However, there is no date listed for their marriage ceremony. Given that information, we believe they either broke up before the big day, or as we often see on Love Is Blind, went through with the ceremony, but someone did not say "I do."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Jeramey and Laura</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Although Jeramey was also talking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Ann</a> in the pods, he ultimately chose Laura. The two weirdly bonded over cleaning as Jeramey wowed her with his robot vacuum ownership and dedication to keeping his home tidy.</p><p>On their engagement trip, Laura seemed to quickly tire of Jeramey's antics, and things started to escalate when he shared <a href=#>that NSFW "bean dip" joke</a> with AD. Fast forward to his DM exchange with Sarah Ann and the fact that he seemingly stayed out all night "talking" to her and Laura and Jeramey's relationship seemed to have past the point of no return.</p><p>According to marriage records in Mecklenburg County, N.C., Jeramey and Laura never started the marriage application process, unless they were filed under different names. We can likely assume they broke up before their wedding day.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Jimmy and Chelsea</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Let's be real, Chelsea and Jimmy were messy from the beginning. Not only did Chelsea form a connection in the pods with Jimmy, but she also connected with poor <a href=#>Trevor Sova,</a> who told her that he loved her. While Jimmy also confessed his love to her, he spent most of his time in the pods trying to decide between her and single mom <a href=#>Jessica Vestal</a>.</p><p>Upon meeting IRL, Chelsea couldn't help but shake the feeling that Jimmy wasn't attracted to her (perhaps because she wasn't <a href=#>Megan Fox</a>), and his comments about AD's "stacked" body definitely didn't help ease her concerns.</p><p>Jimmy and Chelsea, unless they are using different names, do not appear to be listed in the marriage index for Mecklenburg County, N.C. This means they didn't start the marriage application process and likely broke up before the big day.</p><p>Love Is Blind Season 6 is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoby3sYyiqmaanJ67pXnSnpisp55ig26vzq6npZ2jYruwww%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicole-ren-e.html><span>←</span><span>Nicole Rene</span></a>
