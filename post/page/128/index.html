Being stuck inside a house for 99 days with strangers is going to lead to disagreements. There’s no denying that. However, some just can’t help but cross that line during their time in the Big Brother house, in turn, receiving the title of “villain.” While many lean right into it — Dick Donato sure doesn’t mind the name “Evel Dick” — others are quick to shoot it down.
Jackson Michie, who won season 21 in 2019, was completely shocked by claims of bullying and racism made against him by fellow houseguests Ovi Kabir, David Alexander and Kemi Fakunle.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>7 Things Every Commuter Needs</h2><time>Jul 28, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../commuter-essentials.html></a>
Some people spend hours every day on their commutes to and from work. In fact, according to The Washington Post, Americans spent more than nine full days commuting in 2017. Yikes. But since, at least for the time being, people seem to be stuck giving up so much time to just getting to and from work, they should at least be able to make the most of that time. Whether someone gets to work by car, bicycle, train or some other means of transportation, the journey can always be made just a little bit easier.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A Brief Recounting of Me Watching Ammonite on My Couch</h2><time>Jul 28, 2024</time>

At least hanging a giant mirror with my girlfriend during intermission felt queer, unlike this movie. This piece originally ran in November, but now that Ammonite is finally available to watch on demand, we’re republishing it. Warning: spoilers ahead.
To set the scene: It’s a Monday evening. The plan is to cook dinner for my girlfriend and then park it on the couch together to watch Ammonite, the new lesbian period drama starring Saoirse Ronan and Kate Winslet.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Andrew Wilson Net Worth - Pulptastic</h2><time>Jul 28, 2024</time>

The X2 also appears to be outfitted with a slightly darker grey shell than the original X. Alongside the X which I borrowed, the X2 looks almost black. It’s hard to say whether that’s just because his X has faded considerably, or whether the X2 has been intentionally made darker so people can tell the two apart. It’s probably a subtle thing similar to the way Apple made logos chrome between the 3G and 3GS to differentiate the two.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How did detectives solve Connie Dabates murder case using a Fitbit?</h2><time>Jul 28, 2024</time>

Two days before Christmas in 2015, Connie Dabate was gunned down by a masked intruder in her suburban Ellington home, as claimed by her husband, Richard, who was also present at the scene. Connie was found dead in the basement, while Richard was discovered in the kitchen with superficial injuries, partly tied to a folding chair.
However, the narrative progressively unraveled as detectives began to depend on a silent but crucial witness - a Fitbit fitness tracker that captured Connie's final movements, revealing a series of events that contradicted her husband's sob story.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>iva colter</h2><time>Jul 28, 2024</time>
