<a href=../../../title-proof-searching-for-jerry-garcia.html></a>
I was expecting a D-12 sound… an Eminem sound….at least a Detroit sound (whatever that is). Searching For Jerry Garcia offers none of that. Proof’s first solo album is an eclectic mix of styles, flows, topics, etc reminiscent of Garcia himself.
The album centers on Proof‘s search for himself, providing a welcomed introspective account of his life, his thoughts, and his mentality. I say ‘welcomed’ because it would have been easy for D-12s second most accomplished MC to either a) ride on the coattails of his super platinum mentor and close personal friend Eminem b) set out to prove that he’s tighter than people give him credit for c) capitalize on the success of Shady/Aftermath by throwing any and everybody hot on the album to guarantee commercial success.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Solomon Wilcots Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents.</h2><time>Jul 25, 2024</time>
