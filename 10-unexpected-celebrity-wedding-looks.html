And as we expected, when the two wed just a few weeks ago in New York, Palermo's nontraditional bridal look caused tons of oohs and ahhs—and it wasn't because she was doused in tons of chantilly lace and beaded crystals. Instead, Palermo stepped out in chic Carolina Herrera separates, breaking bridal rules in all the right ways.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Palermo isn't the first to say "I do" in an unexpected ensemble. Brides have ditched the traditional precedents that says they must wear white on their wedding day. Take a look at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sarah Jessica Parker</a> (above, right)—who's undeniably the queen of successful risk-taking—she departed from traditional white and went in the complete option direction when she chose to wear black for her big day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But breaking bridal is nothing new—it just keeps getting better. One of the most iconic wedding looks that still stands out today is that of Bianca Jagger's. When the actress wed Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger in Saint-Tropez in 1971, she wore a YSL Le Smoking jacket and accessorized with an over-the-top wide brim hat that was complete with a veil. How's that for nontraditional?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To see Bianca's look as well as celebrities who wore pink, lavish jewelry, and unforeseen silhouettes, click through the gallery.</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hilary-rhoda-in-a-pop-of-color></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Hilary Rhoda in a Pop of Color</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Matt Agudo/INFphoto.com</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Showing off her sinewy form, Rhoda donned an unconventional choice, in a Carolina Herrera column with plunging neckline lined with jade embellishment. Sweet touches of grosgrain detailing and a dramatic, floor-sweeping veil finished out the modern look.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-olivia-palermo-in-separates></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Olivia Palermo in Separates</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>INSTAGRAM/JOHANNESHUEBL</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When word broke out that Olivia Palermo and her longtime boyfriend Johannes Huebl decided to tie the knot, we knew Palermo's look for the big day would be one for the books. For her New York wedding, the impossibly chic style star chose a cream-colored cashmere top, sleek shorts, and a romantic tulle overlay skirt by Carolina Herrera.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mia-farrow-in-a-cropped-coat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mia Farrow in A Cropped Coat</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Keystone/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Mia Farrow married Frank Sinatra in Las Vegas in 1966, she chose to add a double-breasted blazer jacket to her all-white ensemble. At just 21 years old, Farrow gave the covered-up bridal look-which was modern for its time-a refreshing take when she selected a crisp cut, cropped silhouette with ornate buttons.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-keira-knightley-in-a-short-dress></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Keira Knightley in a Short Dress</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Landov</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Talk about low-maintenance!
