Not only was her bold take on the gala gown an unexpected choice, but so was her company on the red carpet.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the formal occasion, Katy made a case for wearing a bra top at an evening event, pairing a metallic version with a matching high-waisted ballgown skirt. The ab-baring shirt featured a flattering scoop neckline, thick straps, and circular ribbed detailing on its lower half. Taking a sartorial risk that paid off, Katy accessorized with dangling gold-chain earrings and a stack of bangles on one wrist. Her dark hair was pulled back into an elegant updo with a face-framing tendril, and she rounded out her glam with a matte pink lip and long lashes.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the event, Katy presented model, entrepreneur, and her fiancé Orlando Bloom's ex-wife, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Miranda Kerr</a>, with the night's Excellence in Arts Award. But before they synched up on stage, the two posed for pictures together on the red carpet. In the snapshots, Miranda wore a white strapless dress with ruching, and finished off her look with silver peep-toe heels and bombshell waves.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Many of you may be confused as to why I’m presenting Miranda with this award,” Perry said during her time on stage. “It doesn’t fit the ex-wife, new wife narrative. Many in the media would like to see us mud wrestle … but this is about love, and Miranda is love"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Katy and I are family,"&nbsp;Kerr <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said on the red carpet</a>. "We are the modern family, you know? Who better to present the award to me? Someone who knows me so well, and she said yeah — so here we are."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kerr, who shares 11-year-old son Flynn with Bloom, has previously spoken about her easy&nbsp;relationship with Perry. "From day one, when Orlando and I separated, we have been very close, really good friends. I always have wanted the best for him, and he's always wanted the best for me," the supermodel said during a conversation on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ladies First with Laura Brown</a> podcast in 2021. "It's incredible that we've been able to find other partners who work really well with us. Evan and Orlando really get along just as well as Katy and I, so it's such a blessing, and it doesn't need to be any other way. It can be harmonious and you can be super kind."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miranda added that she and Katy "just clicked instantly so easily, like we had been friends before or something" when they were introduced for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ypqrsmWgmr%2BzxYybqZplpKS9bq7ApaNmq5uev7V50Z6bZpuRp72mwIymoKuZnpmubrfEq6lmb2FlfXV%2FmA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-bieber-sings-cry-me-a-river-after-selena-gomez-split-20121211.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Bieber Sings &amp;quot;Cry Me a River&amp;quot; After Selena Gomez Split</span></a>
