But the most marvelous difference can be heard right away when the show’s classic theme song kicks in: Here, it’s a slightly sleazier rendition (more wah-wah guitar) with scat vocals in place of the now-familiar “Come and knock on our door” lyrics. It’s like listening to a drunk nostalgist who can’t remember the words! </span></span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span><span><span><span></span></span></span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e26f9f831653a72260abb687767720d3-3-0-0@published data-word-count=78><span><span><span><span><span><span>Plot-wise, though, the pilot will seem familiar; as with the first episode that aired on ABC, the show begins with Jack in a bathtub and his future roommates recovering from a wild, </span></span></span><span><span><span><i>Boogie Nights</i></span></span></span><span><span><span>–</span></span></span><span><span><span>like wedding reception the night before.
