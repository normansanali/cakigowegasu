On top of the hush money scandal that caused his initial exit, <a href=#>Vince McMahon is also under investigation with the SEC</a>, and he is fully cooperating with them.</p><p>Vince McMahon is alleged to have paid a minimum of $14.6 million to multiple women, including former WWE employees, to maintain their silence regarding claims of sexual misconduct and infidelity dating back to 2006. An additional $5 million was reportedly paid to the Donald Trump Foundation for Trump’s television appearances in 2007 and 2009.</p><p>Although they didn’t bring any monetary value or campaign contributions to the mix, it seems that WWE is doing something very interesting in NXT to emulate Vince McMahon’s current situation. Chase U is running an investigation angle on its founder, Andre Chase, and things are hitting a bit close to home.</p><p>“They’re doing a storyline where Chase U is under investigation,” Bryan Alvarez noted during <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a>. The similarities to ongoing real-life issues was not lost on them.</p><p>“So, they’re like Vince McMahon?” Dave Meltzer quipped. This brought Bryan Alvarez to continue explaining the current NXT storyline, and he was quite straight-forward about things.</p><p>“Yeah, Andre Chase is fully cooperating with the investigation, it is business as usual, but the students they’re walking out on Chase U which led to a distraction and then the finish. So, Chase U is imploding in the story”</p><p>Chase U lost the NXT Tag Team Titles to Tony D’Angelo and Stacks during the November 14th episode of NXT. That match kicked off the show, and then the angle wasn’t mentioned again. Only time will tell how that investigation turns out for Andre Chase.</p><p>WWE has run a plethora of controversial angles in the past, and some of them included inside jokes. This investigation angle for Chase U is certainly close to what Vince McMahon is presently going through, and it makes us have to wonder where the similarities will end.</p><p>What’s your take on WWE’s new NXT angle with Chase U?
