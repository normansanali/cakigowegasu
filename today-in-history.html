Considered to be the cradle of Orthodox Christianity, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe for centuries. The city is famous for its architectural masterpieces, most notably the Hagia Sofia and the Imperial Palace. Constantinople, previously called Byzantium, was considered the Nova Roma (New Rome) after Roman emperor Constantine I officially declared the city the new capital of Rome.</p><h2>1811: Conjoined Twins Chang And Eng Bunker Are Born</h2><p>Conjoined twins <a href=# rel=noopener>Chang and Eng Bunker</a>, connected by a fleshy band at their sternum, are born in Siam (present-day Thailand).</p><h2>1894: The Pullman Strike Begins In Chicago</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-421158 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pullman-strike-burned-rail-cars.jpeg alt="Pullman Strike" width=678 height=381 sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-421158 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Chicago History Museum/Getty Images </span><span class=caption-body>Railway workers burned railcars during the Pullman Strike.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Pullman Strike</a> begins in Chicago. The Pullman Palace Car Company began cutting workers’ wages after the economic depression of 1893, causing workers to strike. The company’s president, George M. Pullman, refused to meet with the angry workers, and as a result, the workers walked off their job sites.</p><p>After attracting the attention and support of the American Rail Union (ARU), the striking workers, now numbering in the hundred thousands, halted 29 major railroads. The federal government deployed troops to help end the strike, resulting in widespread violence and millions of dollars in damage. The strike eventually died down after railroad companies began hiring non-union workers, and the federal government created “Labor Day” as a national holiday to remember the incident and others like it.</p><h2>1969: The Battle Of Hamburger Hill Begins</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-421166 alt="Battle Of Hamburger Hill" width=800 height=627 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/battle-hamburger-hill-airborne-soldiers.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-421166 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>United States Army Military History Institute</span><span class=caption-body>Wounded 101st Airborne soldiers are loaded into medevac helicopters after Operation Apache Snow.</span></p><p>The controversial Battle of Hamburger Hill begins in Vietnam. A part of Operation Apache Snow, the battle was an attempt by American forces to take the hill and therefore cut off North Vietnamese forces and protect nearby towns.</p><p>After suffering a high number of casualties, U.S. forces were forced to fall back. The battle raged for 10 days, and journalists covering the conflict nicknamed it the Battle of Hamburger Hill after this statement was made by 19-year-old Sergeant James Spears: “Have you ever been inside a hamburger machine? We just got cut to pieces by extremely accurate machine gun fire.” The hill was eventually captured by U.S. forces and subsequently abandoned, but the brutality of the clash sparked fierce criticism from anti-war activists and American politicians.</p><h2>1981: Bob Marley Dies</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-424535 alt="Bob Marley" width=900 height=601 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bob-marley-onstage.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-424535 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Bob Marley raises his first while singing onstage in 1977.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Bob Marley dies</a> of cancer in Miami.

Decades after his death, <a href=# rel=noopener>Bob Marley</a> remains one of the most celebrated icons in music history.</p><h2>1996: Beck Weathers “Dies” on Mount Everest</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Beck Weathers</a> “dies” on Mount Everest. After collapsing in the snow, Beck Weathers was considered as good as dead to his team. In fact, they called his wife to tell her that her husband had died on the mountain. Rescuers tried to save Weathers, but they ultimately decided he was too far gone. Later, Weathers surprised his whole team when he strolled back into camp. He showed that, despite being stranded under the snow of Mount Everest, he was still very much alive. Weather’s story is one of the most miraculous Mount Everest survival tales in history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ52Wxm59kA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-are-the-three-stars-on-the-mls-logo.html><span>←</span><span>What are the three stars on the MLS logo?</span></a>
