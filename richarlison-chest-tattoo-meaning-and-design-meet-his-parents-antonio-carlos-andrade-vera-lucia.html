He has four brothers and one sister.</span></p><p><span>One of his brothers, Rian,&nbsp;</span><span>shared</span><span>&nbsp;that Richarlison inspired him as he made his first steps into European football.</span></p><p><span>As we can guess, Richarlison had a lot of responsibility growing up. He helped his parents make money by selling ice cream, chocolates and washing cars while his friends sold drugs.</span></p><p><span>The friends also tried to tempt Richarlison into their Company. They invited him to make easy money by selling drugs, but he never succumbed to criminal life.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, his mom and dad gave him a good moral upbringing, and Richarlison says he is grateful for their belief and support.</span></p><p><span>When Richarlison was seven, his dad bought him ten balls because he wanted his son to be a good footballer. He used to play with his friends in the street and have a good time.</span></p><p><span>From an early age, he dreamed of playing in the Premier League. He said, “I used to watch the Premier League on my uncle’s TV. I was in love with what I saw — the speed of the game and the way it never stopped.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqZmLWivsuiqqimXZi1pr%2FTZquarKSkvG65xJqloqaXYq6vsIydnKyhl6N6rrHErWShoaNivaK%2BxKerrGWRo8GwusioZJyZoqG8tHnAp5urmZSaerex0Zpkpa2Tnq5w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pikachu-temporal-forces-51.html><span>←</span><span>Pikachu (Temporal Forces 51) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
