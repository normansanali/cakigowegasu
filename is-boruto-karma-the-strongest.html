It allows the members to inscribe a seal on the body of any person and use it as a vessel. The seal contains the biological data of the Otsutsuki and serves as a great backup for them in case they take serious damage in battle.<h2>Can Boruto control his karma?</h2>While an Otsutsuki's DNA is inside, they have the ability to choose whether or not to assist their host. After a significant amount of training, some people, such as Kawaki and future Boruto, can control their karma seal at will, allowing them to use immense powers comparable to an Otsutsuki.<h2>Is Boruto karma stronger than Kawaki?</h2>9 WEAKER THAN KAWAKI: Boruto Uzumaki<p>Although he's strong, Boruto is nowhere near the level of Kawaki. While he does possess Karma, along with the Jougan, he can't control either of them. By his age, Kawaki had already been trained to use the Karma.</p><h2>What is Boruto karma?</h2>Kawaki, Boruto, Jigen. More. Karma (楔, Kāma) is a seal bestowed by members of the Ōtsutsuki Clan that takes the form of a four-point. Also Karma acts as an Ōtsutsuki backup file for their consciousness. Upon death, an Ōtsutsuki can resurrect themselves using the karma seal they put on a vessel.<h2>The Full Power Of Mastered Karma Boruto Is Broken!</h2><p></p><h2>Who has the strongest karma?</h2>But as of right now, it seems that Kawaki's is the strongest in pure strength while Boruto's the furthest along in development. Chapter 67 continues showcasing the new abilities that Kawaki now has at his disposal with his new Karma, and he outclasses Code in terms of sheer power.<h2>Is Boruto a Otsutsuki?</h2>Momoshiki confirms that the Karma completely extracted 100% of the Otsutsuki DNA and thus Boruto is officially a complete Otsutsuki. Momoshiki confirms that he'll still be a fitting sacrifice for the Ten Tails and that he's still got something terrible coming in his future.<h2>Why did Kawaki turn evil?</h2>Theorists believed that the process changed and Isshiki's mind was placed in Kawaki's body, which was then used to carry out the alien's bidding. However, when Isshiki died and Kawaki lost his Karma mark in the manga, fans were left to come up with new theories as to why Kawaki would turn evil.<h2>Is Himawari stronger than Boruto?</h2>So those are some of the reasons why Himawari has the potential to become a strong character, even stronger than Boruto in terms of pure abilities.<h2>Is Karma stronger than rinnegan?</h2>And The Rinnegan chakra absorbtion is x100 better than Karma absorption, Rinnegan dojutsu absorbs chakra from every and any direction at once, meanwhile Karma absorbs it through the hands so far.<h2>Who gave Boruto Jougan?</h2>Boruto inherited Jougan because of his bloodline from Hinata and Naruto, not because Toneri or someone mysteriously gave him the eye.<h2>Will Boruto become evil?</h2>It seems unlikely that Boruto will turn into a villain, at least by his own accord. However, the presence of the karma seal indicates that there is a possibility that Momoshiki Otsutsuki has possessed Boruto to go on a rampage that devastates the shinobi world.<h2>Why is Kama so strong?</h2>To summarise, Kāma seal is RIDICULOUSLY STRONG due to it having Otsutsuki powers.<h2>Can Boruto control his Jougan?</h2>Even at a young age, Sasuke, Hinata, and Neji were shown to have mastery over their kekkei genkais. While Boruto can't control the Jougan yet, he will eventually learn to control it.<h2>What is white karma?</h2>The villain admits the White Karma is left behind when the black mark fails to take. A white symbol indicates the wearer is not suitable to become an Otsutsuki vessel, but they can withstand the clan's power. As such, Code can use Otsutsuki powers just like Momoshiki and Isshiki could.<h2>Who controls Jigen?</h2>Jigen (ジゲン, Jigen) was a novice monk that became the vessel for Isshiki Ōtsutsuki, and eventually had his body completely taken over by Isshiki invading it.<h2>Who is the main villain of Boruto?</h2>Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki (in Japanese: 大筒木モモシキ, Ōtsutsuki Momoshiki) is a major antagonist in the manga/anime series, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, appearing as the main antagonist in Boruto: Naruto the Movie. He is a high-ranking member of the Ōtsutsuki clan. He has a minion by the name of Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki.<h2>Will Boruto learn sage mode?</h2>Keeping that in mind, it isn't too hard to see that Boruto can eventually learn the Sage Mode as well. He certainly does have all the prerequisites for this technique and only needs to train hard to pull it off.<h2>Is Kawaki an Uchiha?</h2>Kawaki's appearance draws curiosity as well. The tattoo under his left eye looks more like a brand than art, and his sleeveless overcoat is embroidered with a symbol not unlike the Uchiha, but Kawaki himself has no affiliation with any ninja clans.<h2>Is Kawaki a Otsutsuki?</h2>Kawaki is almost a complete Otsutsuki being. Kawaki's body was made to be a vessel for Isshiki Otsutsuki and for quite a long time, he bore the Karma which was slowly taking over his body with time. By the time Kawaki lost his Karma, his body had already been Otsutsukified up to about 80%.<h2>Is Boruto 100% Otsutsuki now?</h2>As for Boruto, he is now 100% Otsutsuki and ceases to be a human, at least biologically. Consequently, his body is now fit to be fed to the Ten-Tails, meaning Code will target him sooner rather than later.<h2>Is Boruto a jinchuuriki?</h2>Boruto is not a Jinchuriki, as he does not have any tailed beast sealed within him. After the fourth shinobi war, all the beasts regained their freedom and went their separate ways, except the Eight and Nine-Tails, who voluntarily remained with Killer Bee and Naruto.<h2>Is Hinata an Otsutsuki?</h2>Hinata Hyuga is a member of Konohagakure's Hyuga Clan and Team Hirashi, and the descendant of Hamura Otsutsuki. She is also the long-time girlfriend of the Shinobi World Hero, Naruto Uzumaki.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZJunoqrBsHnKmqmmmV2ptaZ50q2pqKaXmsC1</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-is-ivan-drago-worth-3.html><span>←</span><span>How much is Ivan Drago worth?
