Soon after Shinhwa announced its February 2015 comeback with a full-length album, MBC announced it is lifting the ban on Lee.</p><p>In November 2013, Lee was indicted with illegally gambling on soccer matches, resulting in a fine of 5 million KRW. Shinhwa apologized on-air for Lee's crime in December 2013 and Lee withdrew from all individual and group activities. As part of the hiatus, Lee's previously filmed appearances on broadcast shows such as "Shinhwa Broadcast" were edited out. In February 2014, television station Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) announced Lee would be banned from broadcasting on the network.</p><p>In March 2012, Lee reunited with his Shinhwa bandmates for their comeback after four years, under the management of 'Shinhwa Company'. It is a joint venture agency for members to perform as a group, of which Eric and <a href=#>Lee Min-woo</a> are co-CEOs and the remaining members are shareholders. The Company manages the group as a whole, whilst members' individual activities are managed by their respective agencies. The group released their tenth studio album The Return on 23 March 2012, launched their comeback concerts 2012 Shinhwa Grand Tour: The Return throughout Asia and their first exclusive variety program Shinhwa Broadcast premiered on 17 March 2012 on cable channel JTBC.</p><p>In November 2009, Lee commenced an Asia tour with stops in Taipei, Tokyo and Shanghai and concluded it just after Christmas and held a fan meeting, Andy Farewell Party-Bye for now a week before his enlistment. He enlisted for his mandatory military service on 11 January 2010 for 21 months of active duty at the Ministry of National Defense in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. He was discharged on 31 October 2011.</p><p>In 2010, TOP Media, Andy's agency, debuted its first boy band Teen Top.</p><p>In March 2008, Andy joined MBC's reality show We Got Married where he was a couple with singer Solbi to act out the lives of newlyweds. Solbi and Andy made their official exit from We Got Married on October 5, 2008. He has taken an active career in stage such as playing as playing a 19-year-old in the musical Polaroid in August 2008, as well as live concerts throughout September and October. He has also produced a two-member boy band called Jumper under his company ND Entertainment. They have released two singles titled YES! featuring Eric and 눈이부셔 (Sparkling Eyes) featuring Kang Jiyoung of Kara.</p><p>In 2007, Lee left his group's management to set up his own company, ND (New Dream) Entertainment, concentrating on his solo career. As Shinhwa was on hiatus, Lee return to acting in September 2007 to act as the lead role in a musical "Music In My Heart (Season 3)", a type of project that none of the Shinhwa members have tried to pursue yet. After finishing performances for the musical, Lee released his very first digital single, titled "Irrelevant [or Extraordinary] Imagination" on November 30, 2007, a cover from the group Rollercoaster's song. Due to the help of Park Jin Young (also known as JYP; CEO of JYP Entertainment) and Yubin of Wonder Girls, Lee was able to have a successful single. Yubin rapped while JYP wrote the lyrics for the rap part in the song. With the help, Lee was able to attract a lot of attention for the single. By releasing the digital single as well, Lee became the 5th member in Shinhwa to go solo behind <a href=#>Lee Min-woo</a>, <a href=#>Shin Hye-sung</a>, Jun Jin, and <a href=#>Kim Dong-wan</a>, leaving Eric Mun as the only member to have not yet pursue a solo singing career.</p><p>In 2003, when the members of Shinhwa began doing solo activities, Lee surprised everyone by being an actor on various dramas, most notably the drama Lovers In Prague. Although he had a very minor role in the drama, it gained many viewers because of his role as a completely different, serious person. He began appearing in many banjun drama as well alongside former Fin.K.L member Lee Jin. The two acted together in numerous other banjun dramas as well as a couple for 6 months, longer than any other couple or actors/actresses did on the show segment for which they gained a lot of popularity due to their perfect match and chemistry. Lee was also an MC on SBS Inkigayo and MBC Goldfish, though in January 2007, he step down from being MC on both SBS Inkigayo and MBC Goldfish in a period of 3 days (SBS Inkigayo on January 28 & MBC Goldfish on January 31).</p><p>Lee Sun-ho (Korean:&nbsp;이선호 ; Hanja:&nbsp;李先皓 ; born January 21, 1981), mononymously credited as Andy (Korean:&nbsp;앤디 ), is a South Korean singer, rapper and the youngest in the six-member boy band Shinhwa.
