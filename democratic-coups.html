Apart from a long-term constitutional crisis, landlocked Niger has to grapple with the fact that it’s filled with tribes that never had to live with each other in one country before the French Empire collapsed.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-101621 alt="Salou Djibo" width=900 height=649 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/at-desk.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-101621 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>BOUREIMA HAMA/AFP/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Niger junta leader Salou Djibo speaks on March 15, 2011 in his Niamey office.</span></p><p>Worse, more than 80 percent of the country is pure sand, with just a little bit of green down south where everybody lives. The nation is the size of Tibet, and yet somehow has less arable land and fewer decent prospects. Niger ranks dead last, or close to last, on virtually every metric for human development, behind even perennially downtrodden states such as Haiti and Somalia.</p><p>Which makes it all the more surprising that Niger’s military has been such a responsible steward of the people’s interests over the years. The country’s first fully independent government was a civilian one-party dictatorship that ran Niger until the sub-Saharan famine of 1974. That food shortage got everybody in the country concerned about government corruption and which ministers were stealing which tribes’ grain allotments.</p><p>One coup later, the military assumed power and sent mixed signals by liberating the previous regime’s political prisoners and violently suppressing at least three major coup attempts of its own. A referendum in 1989 established a new civilian government, which descended into a mix of anarchy and tyranny, which prompted another military coup in 1996.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-101622 alt="Colonel Daouda Mallam Wanke" width=600 height=858 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/wanke-portrait.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-101622 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>AFP/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Colonel Daouda Mallam Wanke in Togo on December 10, 1999.</span></p><p>This time, Col. Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara ruled by decree for just six months before convening a constitutional convention and handing power over to the Fourth Republic (in 36 years), though he carried on as the elected president.</p><p>This experiment in democracy lasted somewhat less than the five years its predecessor did. In fact, it only got as far as 1999 before Maïnassara was assassinated in another military coup run by Maj. Daouda Malam Wanké, who quickly stepped aside to let the country have another stab at democracy.</p><p>When the president of that civilian government tried to abolish the Constitutional Court and arbitrarily extend his term in office in February 2010, he was <a href=#>overthrown by elements</a> of the military loyal to Captain Salou Djibo (note the descending ranks of the chief plotters. Niger’s next coup may be led by a lieutenant). That coup has since resolved into yet another constitution and the dawn of the Seventh Republic.</p><p>Next, read how the U.S. dismantled democracies around the world with these <a href=#>CIA programs</a>.
