This is a result of our pasteurization and the higher protein, but it’s <b>perfectly normal and totally safe</b>. We’re working on solving this issue. We apologize for the poor experience with that!<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-fairlife-milk-spoil></span>Does Fairlife milk spoil?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Thanks to ultra-pasteurization, 52oz fairlife ultra-filtered milk has a longer shelf life than conventional milk. While <b>unopened and refrigerated, it lasts up to 110 days</b> (fairlife DHA lasts up to 90 days). Once open, however, it should remain refrigerated and be consumed within 14 days.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-lactose-free-milk-supposed-to-smell-bad></span>Is lactose free milk supposed to smell bad?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The best way is to smell and look at the lactose-free milk: signs of bad lactose-free milk are a <b>sour smell</b>, off color and a thick or clumpy texture.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-does-my-milk-smell-bad-but-taste-fine></span>Why does my milk smell bad but taste fine?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The smell is due to waste products (poop, if you wish) from bacteria. The bad taste is caused <b>when the bacteria consume all the sugars (lactose) in the milk</b>, in addition to all their waste products.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-fairlife-milk-taste-different></span>Does Fairlife milk taste different?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To my surprise, <b>Fairlife tastes, well, like milk</b>. It looks and feels a little thicker than traditional milk, and has a slightly richer taste, especially the chocolate milk, which sits on the spectrum between chocolate shake and milk that’s stewed on a lazy Saturday morning in a bowl of Cocoa Puffs.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-does-fairlife-milk-last-so-long></span>Why does fairlife milk last so long?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>It’s simply in the processing. Most regular milk is pasteurized at a high temperature for 15-20 seconds. We pasteurize our milk at an even higher temperature for less time. That gives fairlife® a <b>much longer shelf life unopened</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-fairlife-milk-any-good></span>Is fairlife milk any good?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Since the lactose in fairlife is removed in the filtration process, it’s a <b>great alternative</b> for people who are lactose intolerant or are on a lower sugar diet. It’s also a great product for people who want to add protein to their diet. I think fairlife brings more options to the dairy aisle and choice is a good thing.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-get-sick-from-expired-lactose-free-milk></span>Can you get sick from expired lactose free milk?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Generally, as long as the milk smells and looks OK, <b>it’s probably still safe to consume</b>. But even accidentally consuming milk that has gone a little sour probably isn’t going to cause a serious illness, since the pasteurization process kills most disease-causing pathogens.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whats-wrong-with-fairlife></span>What’s wrong with Fairlife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>What Happened at Fairlife Milk? … In June 2019, <b>undercover footage of appalling animal abuse at a dairy farm that supplied milk to Fairlife went viral</b>, prompting many customers to boycott the “ultrafiltered” milk company that had claimed to care about animal welfare.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-there-a-recall-on-fairlife-milk></span>Is there a recall on Fairlife milk?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There is no health risk and only the best by dates outlined below are impacted.<br>…<br>Product Recall: Fairlife Chocolate Milk with DHA.<table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th style=padding-left:0>Product Name</th><th>UPC</th><th>Best By Dates</th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Fairlife Chocolate Milk with DHA 52 oz.</td><td>8-11620-02089-3</td><td>January 26,2020 January 27,2020 January 31,2020 February 1,2020 March 2,2020</td></tr></tbody></table>Jan 9, 2020<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-can-you-leave-fairlife-milk-out></span>How long can you leave Fairlife milk out?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>It’s real milk, just ultra-pasteurized.. meaning they “Cooked” it longer to eliminate all the bacteria that would normally make it spoil. You can store it at room temperature for <b>up to 6 months</b> as long as it’s unopened.
