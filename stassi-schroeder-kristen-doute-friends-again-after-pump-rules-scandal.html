Fans watched their feud play out on season 8 of <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a>, with Schroeder addressing the fallout during the May 19 finale.</p><p>“It was years of <a href=#><strong>Katie [Maloney]</strong></a> and I dealing with this constant cycle,” Schroeder said on the aftershow. “You’re taking up so much of my time and now it’s consuming a big part of my brain and my energy that I’m now taking this home with me. … Now all I can think about, Kristen, is you and Carter and this whole situation. And you’re lying to us on top of it.”</p><p>Over the past few weeks, however, the stars have <a href=#>reunited on multiple occasions</a>. The latest reunion came on Wednesday, July 8, at La Piazza restaurant at The Grove in Los Angeles.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Schroeder, Doute and fellow Witches of WeHo wine creator Maloney, 33, dined outside and later posed for a photo with a fan. The <a href=#>trio’s wine company</a> was another casualty of the pair’s firing from the series — it was pulled from shelves and online retailers.</p><p>In late June, the He’s Making You Crazy author was spotted at Maloney and <a href=#><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a>’s L.A. home to <a href=#>celebrate Schroeder’s birthday</a>. The pregnant star arrived with her fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Beau Clark</strong></a>, while Doute showed up with her boyfriend, <a href=#><strong>Alex Menache</strong></a>, by her side.</p><p>Earlier in the month, an insider told Us that Doute and Schroeder had <a href=#>started to mend their friendship</a> in light of their Bravo scandal. “While they wouldn’t consider themselves ‘best friends’ at the moment, their personal drama with each other has taken a backseat and they’ve been able to reconnect a little and be there for one another,” the source said at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJGowKp50pyfq6eVmbKzecqroKyslaN6pbvUrZxmnqKesq%2Bw0maYoJmZo3qistOeqWaopaK9br7UpZysZaOYrq%2BwwKVm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-richest-footballer-in-the-world.html><span>←</span><span>Richest Footballer in the World: A Journey Through Wealth and Success</span></a>
