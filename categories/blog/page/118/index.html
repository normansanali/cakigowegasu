<a href=../../../../wecrashed-on-apple-tv-everything-to-know-about-wework-drama.html></a>
The dark side of disruption. The new Apple TV+ series WeCrashed is a fictionalized take on the downfall of WeWork — and Adam Neumann, the man behind the curtain.
Based on David Brown‘s Wondery podcast “WeCrashed: The Rise and Fall of WeWork,” the new series stars Jared Leto as the cofounder of the startup and Anne Hathaway as his wife, Rebekah Neumann.
Adam cofounded the business with Miguel McKelvey in 2010, but WeWork really started to make headlines in 2019 when it was forced to postpone its IPO after journalists questioned the company’s ability to become profitable.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>15 Things About Discovery's 'Dirty Jobs' That Aren't Quite What They Seem</h2><time>Aug 2, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../dirty-jobs-things-arent-quite-what-they-seem.html></a>
Dirty Jobs gives us all the sensory fun we're looking for from reality TV. Viewers tune in to see disgusting, filthy, slimy, and overall gross working conditions and they just can't seem to get enough. There seems to be something captivating about filthy work conditions and Mike Rowe hosts the show perfectly, making it seem like 'just another day' in his disgusting shoes. We never know what sort of sloppy situation Mike will get himself into, but we're always ready to tune in and follow along while he embarks on some filthy adventures.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>All the Music I Didnt Get to Write About This Year (Until Now)</h2><time>Aug 2, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../2023-music-recommendations-html.html></a>
I spent most of 2023 writing about major albums and stand-up specials and video games and cultural boondoggles, sorting through heaps of lyrics, archival interviews, debates, and essays, trying to chisel out a big-picture understanding of whatever hopefully prickly subject I’d chosen that week and maybe grasp at contextualizing the person or people behind it. I thrive on that cycle of absorption and expulsion, of disappearing into someone’s world and sharing what I’ve learned from a few dozen hours of monomania.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Blueface Concerned His &amp;amp; Chrisean Rock's Child Will Be 'Molested'</h2><time>Aug 2, 2024</time>

Chrisean Rock has officially introduced her and Blueface’s newborn baby to the world, but the “Thotiana” rapper is less interested in the child’s cuteness and more concerned with his wellbeing.
On Tuesday (September 5), Chrisean took to Instagram to share the first photo of their son, Chrisean Malone, who she gave birth to just two days earlier.

Taira no Masakado, the very first samurai, is also apparently still the standard-bearer for the age-old warrior class of Japan. According to the Guardian, the story of Masakado's life is just as exciting as his death. His head is his Achilles heel. It's the only place his serpent mother forgot to lick. But other than that he was completely invincible, according to legend. So his enemies cut off his head, which is the only thing that's left buried.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/117/>← Prev Page</a>
