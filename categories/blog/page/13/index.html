<a href=../../../../the-untold-truth-of-beck.html></a>
Experimental musicians don't usually become major rock stars. But the world fell in love with Beck in 1994 because of "Loser," a song that sounded like nothing else on the time. It's a decidedly low-fi, DIY rap song, with a slide guitar riff, a self-deprecating bilingual chorus, dialogue samples, and bizarre lyrics like "dog food skulls and the beefcake pantyhose."&nbsp;Amazingly, "Loser" hit #10 on the pop chart, and Beck's long career was truly underway.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Top 10 Most Viewed Super Bowls of All Time</h2><time>Sep 26, 2024</time>

It feels like such long time ago now (11 years, yikes)… many of those early memories are fuzzy, but a few stand out.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Robert Eyer dating?
