これまでにも多くのところで車すきを公言し、インスタやツイッター・ブログでも愛車に対する言及は多くありました。
根っからの車好きのGACKTさんですが、
自分の愛する愛車を傷つけたれたとしたら、
想像もしたくないほどのキレっぷりを披露しそうな・・・、
とりあえず、怖そうなイメージが先行してます。。笑
そんな車を傷つけられたら怖そうなGACKTさんですが、
昨日、自身のインスタの中で、当て逃げに遭ったことを明かし、
その当てられた後の対応のスマートさを讃える声に満ちています。
GACKTが接触事故で神対応
GACKTさんは２月１１日に自身のインスタを更新し、
「いきなりボクのベントレーの横っ腹に右折してきたクルマがぶつかってきた。クルマは傷ついたものの、怒りより衝撃をほとんど感じなかったベントレーの強靭さに感動。ま、クルマは直せばいい。怪我はなかったし怒る必要もなし。
A car hit my Bentley suddenly. I got impressed with the strength of the Bentley. It just needs to be repaired. I don’t need to get angry. 」引用元：GACKTインスタ
と更新し、ファンを心配させたのと同時に、
その対応の大人さに「神対応」と賞賛されているのです。
GACKTさんが乗っていたベントレーに、
横から右折してきた車に衝突されたそうですが、
その車に乗っていた人は、その後どうしたのか・・・。
GACKTさんのラインがその日のうちに更新されると、
自分のインスタの投稿がニュースになっていることに驚きながらも、
相手はそのまま逃げてしまったことを明かしました。
ラインでのGACKTさんは怒ってる様子はなく、
むしろ相手が怪我をしてないか気にかけてました。
その余裕はどこから来るのか？
GACKTさんはやっぱりかっこいい！！
GACKTに怪我はない？ GACKTさんには何も怪我はないようですが、
仮に怪我していたら大変なことになってました。
体が資本のアーティストであり、
今年は世界中でライブを行うことが予想されており、
仮に怪我でライブのパフォーマンスに支障が出たら最悪です。
相手は逃げていますし、
損害賠償も求めることはできませんし、
いろんな意味で散々なことになっていました。
怪我がなくて本当に良かったですが、
GACKTさんが乗っていたベントレーは無事だったのでしょうか？
愛車のベントレーに傷は？ GACKTさんはインスタの中で、
車はまた直せば良いと語っているように、
乗っていたベントレーには多少の傷はあったそうです。</description></item><item><title>How to Set Curls Like Shakira: Celebrity Stylist Tips</title><link>/how-to-set-curls-like-shakira-celebrity-stylist-tips.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/how-to-set-curls-like-shakira-celebrity-stylist-tips.html</guid><description>Sure, Shakira is famous for her hips that certainly don’t lie, but she is also known for her iconic signature curly&amp;nbsp;hair.&amp;nbsp;And while the singer has oscillated between different tones of blonde throughout her career, she’s stayed true to her natural texture.
