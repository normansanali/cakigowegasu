Recently, speaking to EW in relation to his upcoming King Arthur epic&nbsp;Knights of the Roundtable: King Arthur, actor Charlie Hunnam discussed his thoughts about the first film and hopes for the second.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>Agreeing with those who praised&nbsp;Pacific Rim‘s visuals but criticized its slight characterization, Hunnam noted that he feels effects-heavy productions can be limiting for performers and said he hopes that&nbsp;Pacific Rim 2 will dive more deeply into the human characters:</p><p>“I think world creation and monster creation and all of that stuff is exciting as a secondary element of storytelling. When it becomes more important than storytelling, I get very nervous, and you sort of lose me a little bit. Although we tried very hard on&nbsp;Pacific Rim&nbsp;to marry those two elements, I do feel like ultimately it got weighed heavier on the side of spectacle than storytelling.”</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>Of course, Hunnam still stands by the movie that del Toro created and said he’s proud of the way&nbsp;Pacific Rim turned out. But when it comes time to shoot the sequel, the actor has his fingers crossed for a deeper storyline:</p><p>“I hope that we are able to remedy that a little bit going into the second. Not to say I wasn’t proud of the film. I really liked it, and I felt like it delivered exactly what it was supposed to. But I do feel like we could have maybe plumbed the depths of the character and the storytelling a little bit more.”</p><p data-characters=738 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>It’s great to hear an actor being honest about his body of work, especially given that Hunnam’s role in&nbsp;Pacific Rim helped cement him as a real movie star. Though I personally loved&nbsp;Pacific Rim as an action-packed ode to the kaiju&nbsp;movies of yore, it’s easy to see why some took issue with the human side of the story. Given that del Toro has stated his intention to implement a time-jump and explore human society’s evolution after the <i>kaiju</i> war, there’s definitely the potential for a more nuanced, balanced plot – provided that the director doesn’t simply take the opportunity to stage more wonderful Jaeger-kaiju battles, which is a distinct possibility I would still be very on board with.</p><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=107 data-injectable=false>We’ll bring you more on&nbsp;<strong>Pacific Rim 2</strong> as we have it. The sequel has been dated for&nbsp;August 14, 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqGZoqG2pnnHrqWnmZ1isqeyxJyrrKCVlsO6ecWomq6rlZl6sa3Cop2im12ntq55kWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cannes-movie-corsage-starring-vicky-krieps-debuts-first-clip.html><span>←</span><span>Cannes Movie 'Corsage' Starring Vicky Krieps Debuts First Clip</span></a>
