The pair wed in March 2011 and welcomed Tennessee one year later.</p><p class=p1>Following their nuptials and baby boy’s arrival, the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Legally Blonde</a>&nbsp;</i>actress frequently gushed over their connection.</p><p class=p1>“It happened out of the blue,” Witherspoon recalled of how they met<a href=#> in a February 2012&nbsp;cover story for&nbsp;<i>Elle</i></a>. “This&nbsp;really drunk guy was hitting on me, making such an idiot of himself, yelling at me. He was like, [slurring, scowling, pointing finger in her face] ‘You don’t know me.’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, I know. I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;know you!’&nbsp;Jim came over and said, ‘Please excuse my friend. He’s just broken up with someone.’ Jim was a really good friend, pulling him out of that situation. That’s <a href=#>just kind of who he is, a really good person</a>.”</p><p class=p1>While the Pennsylvania native was the actress’ No. 1 cheerleader for many years, they <a href=#>eventually grew apart</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Reese never wanted her marriage to end, but it’s not a secret that this has been brewing for some time,” a source <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>earlier this month</a>, noting that the Hello Sunshine founder “really does adore Jim” and thinks he’s a great father to her children. “[They had a] very healthy relationship and a lot of great times together, [but] like a lot of couples, they grew apart.”</p><p class=p1>A second insider previously told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in December 2021 that the now-estranged couple had<a href=#> privately been getting their finances in order</a> before a divorce. Witherspoon and Toth had started liquidating their joint properties and company holdings more than two years before Friday’s announcement.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to learn more about Toth:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqax02apnp2jmnq4tdOhnKuroKS8r7%2BMnqqtqpGjtKawjKGsrJqRo7FutsimZK2npJ16uLTArWStp12gu7DDjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1375894-matt-hardy-wins-ethan-pages-contract-at-aew-double-or-nothing.html><span>←</span><span>Matt Hardy Wins Ethan Pages Contract At AEW Double Or Nothing</span></a>
