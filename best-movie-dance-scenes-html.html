Dakota Johnson stars as an American ballerina attending a prestigious academy in pre-reunification Berlin, tutored by severe instructors giving her a faintly Satanic vibe. (Perhaps it has something to do with all the meat hooks?) <a href=#>The Damien Jalet–choreographed dances</a> stand out as the most gripping sections in the film’s dense two-and-a-half hours, in particular the fiendish group piece titled <a href=#>“Volk.”</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Johnson and her company, draped in red cords, </a>cycle through razor-edged poses metaphorically — and then literally — coursing with brutality. For the sinister higher-ups, their charges’ perspiration serves as nourishment. At the Markos Dance Academy, movement is the essence of life.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyvzz3n00373961fzritrxt@published data-word-count=128>Dance can be an intense communion between the mind and body, though it doesn’t have to be. Even as the rest of the film rapidly fades from my memory, I can clearly recall the scene in Michael Haneke’s Happy End featuring a karaoke rendition of Sia’s “Chandelier” with an emphatic onstage accompaniment, if only for its extraordinary banality. In the selections below, characters move as a plea for help, as an elated outburst, as a rebellion against authoritarianism, and as a prelude to murder. Dance torments, soothes, stimulates, and challenges, often managing many at once. It predates language itself, some scholars clocking its advent around 3300 B.C. It’s no great stretch to say that dance must be included in whatever expansive definition one might form of “human nature.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyvzz4p00383961cs10fblt@published data-word-count=143>In the following attempt to assemble cinema’s 50 greatest dance scenes, I prioritized breadth: of era, of genre, of tone, of country. An elite handful double up on appearances — Vincente Minnelli, Gene Kelly, Denis Lavant, Fred Astaire, and Stanley Donen — but the full range of movers and shakers comprises A-list movie stars, dancers’ dancers forgotten by history, and rank amateurs giving it their best shot. This canon goes heavy on the musicals, as it must, so take special note of the entries cherry-picked from other realms of storytelling. A film will often place something of great significance in these intimate acts of self-expression, a key unlocking a character’s inner workings. And finally, as is the case with all lists, this should be the beginning of a conversation, not the end of one. Stretch those hammies and step up to the barre.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw838g00343961hwb1vh57@published>50. “Rain on the Roof,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Paddington 2" href=#>Paddington 2</a> (2018)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw832m001l3961k21wd4oj@published data-word-count=117>He might be a bear, but marmalade enthusiast <a href=#>Paddington</a> is first and foremost a very good boy. His starring vehicles imagine a world willing to meet him halfway, where kindness can be a currency and compassion can always save the day. The might of his upbeat optimism even overpowers the machinery of the prison-industrial complex in a credits scene that rejoins the villainous thespian <a href=#>Phoenix Buchanan (Hugh Grant) </a>as he makes the most of his time behind bars. He leads his fellow jailbirds in a peppy selection from Follies, and though the contrast of hardened criminals doing jazz squares technically qualifies as a “joke,” we’re just happy to see them happy. That’s how Paddington would want it.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw838h00363961idglydr0@published>49. “Old Time Rock and Roll,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Risky Business" href=#>Risky Business</a> (1983)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw832p001m3961glh58zp8@published data-word-count=120>Who among us hasn’t slipped on a pair of tube socks and attempted to slide across a waxed hardwood floor while Mom and Dad were away? The inevitable realization that it’s impossible to get as much distance as good son Joel Goodson fits right in with Tom Cruise’s trick-of-the-light persona, an illusion far too charming to ever be real. The movies had to first invent him, and that big bang of charisma takes place the second he convulsed his tighty-whitey-clad tush off of the couch. He’s a rock star home alone, someone who’s got showmanship down to such a precise science that he doesn’t even need an audience to work up the mojo. A star, as it were, is born.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw838i00373961265ereoc@published>48. “Love My Way,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Call Me by Your Name" href=#>Call Me by Your Name</a> (2017)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw832q001n3961fxrad5a0@published data-word-count=125><strong></strong><a href=#>Armie Hammer says</a> that he was nervous when the cameras started rolling, but just look at Oliver’s punum as he cuts a rug on a balmy Italian night: clean, easy un-self-consciousness. The scene that <a href=#>launched a thousand memes</a> won over the public not only because Hammer is absurdly, conspicuously handsome (though that’s a big part of it), but because his Oliver brings the same goofy abandon to his moves that he does to his romance with Timothée Chalamet’s Elio. When we’re wrapped up in passion, we stop worrying about looking cool or playing it aloof.<br>He’s<a href=#> sprung and he doesn’t care who sees</a>, from the adjoined bedrooms where he and Elio play chicken with their bodies to the dance floor, where they let it all out.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw838f00333961hk4tfwm6@published>47. “(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Dirty Dancing" href=#>Dirty Dancing</a> (1987)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw832r001o3961f91vusp3@published data-word-count=120>It’s all about the lift. Go right to 3:23, when Patrick Swayze hoists Jennifer Grey aloft like an offering to an almighty higher power. A person doesn’t even need to know the cursory outline of Footloose to know the lift and intuit its meaning; we’ve got floor seats to the realization of a teenage girl’s hunkiest daydream, as the world melts away and Baby gets lost in Johnny’s sure-handed, supportive grip. Who gives a fig if her dad doesn’t approve? That’s the whole point, that their love can outshine parents or society or even, for a couple seconds, gravity. Grey takes a couple half-steps before taking a flying jump into Johnny’s waiting hands, an act of faith rewarded with trust.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw838g00353961bz7wi4yq@published>46. <a data-vars-anchor-text="“The Best of Times,”" href=#>“The Best of Times,”</a> <a data-vars-anchor-text="Jackass Number Two" href=#>Jackass Number Two</a> (2006)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw832r001p3961aw93w13o@published data-word-count=134>After two-ish hours of vividly imaginative testicular torture, the punishment gluttons of Jackass go out in a blaze of showbiz glory. Paying homage to classics past, from Gold Diggers of 1933 to Buster Keaton’s Steamboat Bill Jr., they barrel through soundstage sets mimicking the swimming pools, cattle ranches, and city blocks of an Old Hollywood back lot. It’s a certified triumph, and deceptively clever for a home movie cooked up by a gang of card-carrying idiots. They place their magnificent self-harm in a creative tradition closer to musical theater than the DIY skate tapes that inspired them, arguing that their willingness to extend the physical form to its limits — and their commitment to entertainment above all else, including good taste — puts them in league with history’s finest hoofers. They’re not entirely wrong.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw838e003239615za9xpyv@published>45. <a data-vars-anchor-text="Audrey’s bohemian dance" href=#>Audrey’s bohemian dance</a>, <a data-vars-anchor-text="Funny Face" href=#>Funny Face</a> (1957)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw832s001q3961e4mins9z@published data-word-count=123>“As a matter of fact, I rather feel like expressing myself now, and I could certainly use a release!” Audrey Hepburn’s full of firecrackers and ready to pop off. Clad in an all-black beatnik ensemble complete with matching turtleneck, she gets her ya-ya’s out in explosive fashion, scrunching herself up and stretching herself as big as she can go. The elaborate choreography betrays the control she has over her steps, but the feeling that she could shake apart at any moment makes Hepburn shine. She twists and writhes like she’s under the sway of the music, showing her companion the visceral relationship between the dancer and the dance. And to whom is she giving this impromptu lesson? Why, none other than Fred Astaire.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83a3003k396168i0gms8@published>44. “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" href=#>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</a> (1953)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw832t001r3961goszvqhj@published data-word-count=131><a href=#>Marilyn Monroe </a>may not have been the best actress of her generation, or the best dancer, but she was without a doubt the best at being Marilyn Monroe. That’s really all that this showstopper requires of her, to be her unattainable bombshell self, though that’s no small order. With a smile wide enough to crack a cheek, she sunbathes in the adoration from a fleet of well-heeled suitors pantomiming suicide for a chance at her hand, only to demure their attentions for sturdy, dependable karats. Of course you want her, but the reason she’s Marilyn goddamn Monroe is that you can’t have her. “Living desire object” is a thankless role that she nonetheless plays with conviction, as shiny and coveted as the precious stones glinting all over her neck and ears.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw838q00383961edzob4cs@published>43. “Baby, I’m a Star,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Purple Rain" href=#>Purple Rain</a> (1984)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw832u001s3961f51vnvh2@published data-word-count=106>There will only ever be one Prince, and the send-off from his quasi-autobiographical Minnesotan origin story finds him at his Princiest, strutting back and forth across the stage he knows full well that he owns. Every kick, every twirl, every flip of the hair is a grace note calibrated by a consummate professional who treats movement the way a jazz saxophonist treats improvisation. Note that director Albert Magnoli never gets closer to Prince than a medium shot; we must always be reminded that he is on the stage’s pedestal, being screamed over by his throng of admirers.

(Happy Googling!) As the carnivorously ambitious Nomi Malone, Elizabeth Berkley doesn’t leave anything to the imagination in this full-frontal frenzy, writhing on yuppie Kyle MacLachlan until he makes a mess of his shorts. Are her spasms of erotic hysterics over the top? For sure, if only to illustrate director Paul Verhoeven’s mixture of bemusement and contempt for the excesses of late-20th-century American culture. In the neon-lit Sodom of Las Vegas, as in the no-holds-barred business of dirty dancing, there is no top to go over. To anyone dismissing Berkley’s heroic go-for-broke turn as “bad acting”: You wouldn’t know good acting if it was grinding all over your crotch.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw838r003939614niv3zpz@published>41. “The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="The Gang’s All Here" href=#>The Gang’s All Here</a> (1943)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw832z001u39610f27ka6z@published data-word-count=133>Plenty of selections from the kaleidoscopic oeuvre of choreographer turned director Busby Berkeley could’ve taken this spot. He electrified dozens of features with his dizzying routines in which arms and legs form shapes and swirls, like marching-band drills on aphrodisiacs and ecstasy. But only one of them features the singular presence of Carmen Miranda, resplendent in her produce-bedecked headdress. The icon leads a squadron of fair fruit maidens in a dance so highly suggestive that the scene is apocryphally said to have been banned in her native Brazil. She grins through the innuendo and the chipper fetishizing of her nationality as if she knows that her performance, and indeed, she herself will one day be reappraised and given her due by camp enthusiasts. If this is all a joke, she’s in on it.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw838u003a3961909140d6@published>40. “Jolly Holiday,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Mary Poppins" href=#>Mary Poppins</a> (1964)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw8333001v3961uupu559s@published data-word-count=121>Dick Van Dyke: unforgivably bad with cockney accents, consummate pro with the ol’ soft-shoe. He tippity-taps his way into a chalk drawing with the noted English nanny and her ruddy-cheeked wards, joining her in a sweet duet about the privilege of her company with accompaniment from a coterie of cheerful cartoon animals. Walt Disney was said to consider Mary Poppins among his greatest successes as a producer, and I suspect that this scene might be why, as it successfully bridges the gap between the animation he made his dominion in Hollywood and the live-action that he could never fully conquer. For one brief shining moment, it seemed like the buoyant Disney spirit could survive in the hostile environment of real life.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw8390003d3961mrm1b6ds@published>39.

She plays <a href=#>ballerina (and likely paranoid schizophrenic) Nina Sayers </a>as a girlish woman in the grip of forces she cannot hope to tame: first doubt, as she beats herself up for not attaining perfection; then desire, as she gets in touch with her id in the fetching form of Mila Kunis; and finally mania, as she surrenders to the darkness in her mind and allows herself to be consumed by it. Her metamorphosis into a majestic CGI bird-creature puts her personal development into phantasmagorical visual terms. She achieves her final form only in death, mastering Swan Lake to the fullest extent by absorbing it.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw838z003c3961inf337w7@published>38. “Simon Zealotes,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Jesus Christ Superstar" href=#>Jesus Christ Superstar</a> (1973)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw8335001x3961f8yhchb3@published data-word-count=137>The year is 1972. It must be 100-degrees Fahrenheit in the Israeli desert. You’ve got a long-haired hippie wig strapped onto your head, you’re probably working for scale, and a sweaty dance instructor keeps yelling at you to keep the energy up and smile. I consider the chorus members in this adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s New Testament rock opera to be American heroes, because in conditions that would have driven ordinary mortals to heatstroke, they are out there earning every blessed cent of that money. This Act One standout is unmatched for sheer hustle, each and every dancer throwing their entire selves into their herky-jerky movements. They want to show a dreamy Christ that he’s got their undivided devotion, and there’s no holier way to do that than laying themselves at his feet in hard-won exhaustion.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83a6003l39610accwr9q@published>37. “Fight the Power,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Do the Right Thing" href=#>Do the Right Thing</a> (1989)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw8336001y3961dtdt4igl@published data-word-count=110>As the video embedded above rightly states, these are the greatest opening credits in movie history, pretty much a living wonder of the world — the Colossus of Rosie. As the firestarters of Public Enemy lay out a guerrilla-rap war zone on the soundtrack, Perez flexes all over a veneer of the Brooklyn brownstones director Spike Lee calls home. She flexes harder than anyone has ever flexed or ever will flex again; she’s the Gene Kelly of flexing, flexing hard enough that she looks ready for a fight even when she’s not rocking the boxing gear. It’s a confrontational start to a confrontational film, jagged and hot with righteous anger.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83ac003m39617n143j4a@published>36. “The Way You Make Me Feel,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Center Stage" href=#>Center Stage</a> (2000)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw833a001z3961w8jcclc1@published data-word-count=135>The Step Up franchise and the rest of the date-night dance-flick set got most of their moves from this teen-geared drama and its cousin film Save the Last Dance. They all regard dance as a commitment and activity, exploring tensions relevant to an audience presumably well-stocked with junior movers and shakers figuring out a class-life balance. A Michael Jackson–scored routine playacting the plot of the film in miniature (hope you like love triangles!) negotiates the gaps between classical and modern, personal and professional, one culture and another. Both Center Stage and Save the Last Dance vaunt movement as the great equalizer, crossing socioeconomic boundary lines to unite anyone with a sufficiently taut torso. The film goes out with a happy marriage of the old and new, succinctly symbolized in a particularly flashy tearaway costume change.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw8390003e3961wn6g9075@published>35. <a data-vars-anchor-text="“Mehbooba Mehbooba,”" href=#>“Mehbooba Mehbooba,”</a> <a data-vars-anchor-text=Sholay href=#>Sholay</a> (1975)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw833b00203961f3o5t3x4@published data-word-count=143>A curious viewer could spend years watching nothing but Bollywood movies and still only scratch the surface of all that the booming industry has to offer, so intimidated novices ought to start with the greatest hits. That distinction definitely befits Ramesh Sippy’s three-hour-plus epic of cops and criminals, as well as the widely seen film’s most widely heard song. Good-for-nothing bandit Gabbar (Amjad Khan, a legend of Hindi cinema) has stopped to rest his bones by a roaring fire with some partying villagers, and a bewitching local (the sex symbol known as Helen) catches his eye with her nautch steps while actor Jalal Agha makes a cameo appearance to twang the rubab.

His 15 minutes in the spotlight first scan as a rigorously committed deadpan bit from Jon Heder, and maybe it’s just because he actually turns out to be a sensual, assured dancer, but the tater tot aficionado resembles a bona fide star until he awkwardly gallops off the stage. Hess condenses the film’s arc into one compact package, introducing Napoleon as an easily-sniggered-at weirdo and gradually shading him in to expose sensitivity, vulnerability — y’know, humanity. Burdened for a decade by office-party parody and overexposure, the film’s reputation is now on the upswing, and it proves its empathetic side when Napoleon splays himself open to share his art with his peers. (Plus, those moon boots are must-haves.)</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83i500443961n192fjps@published>11.

To be specific, that moment is when Channing Tatum and Stephen “tWitch” Boss high-five while pantomiming intercourse on their respective dance partners. This sequel took the splendorous body-worship of the first installment and ran with it, all the way to a hedonistic Avalon governed only by the pleasure principle. <a href=#>Magic Mike XXL</a> is a movie about people who live to make other people feel good, and that director Gregory Jacobs shares that noble mission is never clearer than in Mike’s gloriously gratuitous goodbye. He leaves it all onstage (save for his underwear), groin-thrusting like he’s never groin-thrusted before.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83i300433961r9qptgn6@published>10. “Modern Love,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Mauvais Sang" href=#>Mauvais Sang</a> (1986)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw834s002p3961yls5va95@published data-word-count=124><a href=#>Frances</a> did it, <a href=#>Marty</a> did it, but Alex did it first. Director Leos Carax visualized the epitome of youth in revolt by sending a wiry Denis Levant on a sprint down the rue of his futuristic, disease-ravaged Paris. Alex kills time by having detached, unromantic sex with his crooked employer’s comely lover (Juliette Binoche), and David Bowie’s materializing on the radio sends that disaffected indifference spilling over into hyperkinesis. At first doubling over in apparent agony, Alex then breaks into a mad dash going nowhere in particular, the perfect analogue for a punk bursting with vitality and utterly devoid of direction. His destination makes no difference, at least not to him. He just needs to get all the excess energy out of his system.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83i90046396143v973zl@published>9.

He works his sorceries on a chronological basis, resurrecting long-since-expired pop-cultural cachet by returning his characters and audience to the heyday of the entity in question. Tarantino tapped Travolta with recollections of Saturday Night Fever fresh in his mind, certain that the capacity for greatness had not fled the actor, and he returned the favor by delivering the goods. The slickster audiences knew and loved inhabited Vincent Vega as a specter possesses a vessel, a potent hit of nostalgia emanating from the baggage his celebrity persona brought with it. As Vincent and flirtatious femme fatale Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) lose themselves in a kitsch wonderland that apes the <a href=#>vintage</a> flair of <a href=#>8 1/2</a>, Tarantino’s stew of references falls into the background until all that’s left is the electricity crackling between Travolta and Thurman.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83in00473961f42to3pm@published>8. “Mambo,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="West Side Story" href=#>West Side Story</a> (1961)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw834v002r3961wkkoveg6@published data-word-count=147>What puts this above the brisk dress-swishing of “America,” the greasy testosterone of “Jet Song,” or the madcap hijinks of “Gee, Officer Krupke”? All of West Side Story quivers with the potential for tragedy, and at the dance requiring the Puerto Rican and Anglo-American factions to coexist on the dance floor, the powder keg nearly combusts. Choreographer Jerome Robbins essentially invents the street break-dance battle 20 years ahead of schedule with the face-off between the Jets and Sharks, the groups trading 16-bar segments instead of blows. Amidst the chaos, our Romeo and Juliet (Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood) single one another out and share the special kind of privacy one can only find in a crowd of hectic dancers. But even as partial-focus photography relegates their rival posses to the background, the coiled-spring tension between them persists, their fragile ecosystem teetering on the brink of all-out war.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83j2004b3961nnzbhnx6@published>7. “The Rite of Spring,” <a data-vars-anchor-text=Pina href=#>Pina</a> (2011)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw835a002s39615j2dqoge@published data-word-count=136>The revered dancer, choreographer, and instructor Pina Bausch, whose life and works get a fitting tribute in Wim Wenders’s sumptuous 3D documentary, advanced her art form by conceptualizing it as a holistic philosophy. To put it in the simplest terms, she preached that dance must be first understood and integrated into the dancer’s very soul before it can be performed, and she put that idea into practice with this Stravinsky piece. On a stage layered with peat soil to evoke the base and elemental (complemented by the earth-tone, threadbare nightgowns), groups divided by gender stammer back and forth in anguish, their imperfections and dissonant movements all in service of a loftier cause than simple unison. Prostrating before their high priestess Bausch, they submit their own bodies as the sacrificial payment to enter conversation with the divine.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83j1004a3961tvlxt7gy@published>6.

In Yorgos Lanthimos’s Greek-language breakout, a dictatorial father (Christos Stergioglou) stunts the growth of his daughters (Angeliki Papoulia and Mary Tsoni) by sequestering them in their isolated home, and their arrested development rears its misshapen head as they put on a lo-fi recital for their parents. They shuffle back and forth, caged birds in the same genus as the <a href=#>accordion-playing Joan</a>, until the little sis gets tired and the big sis busts out some salacious moves picked up from furtive viewings of her forbidden Flashdance VHS. Though her intent gets scrambled through the blackly humorous dialect Lanthimos has since spread to our shores, she’s demonstrating her first defiant whims of independence. Like Alex Owens before her, she has no choice but to dance her way out.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83iu00483961wihp1v58@published>5. “Pick Yourself Up,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Swing Time" href=#>Swing Time</a> (1936)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw835c002u3961shp98bgm@published data-word-count=143>No cuts, no close-ups, no camera flimflammery whatsoever. Director George Stevens needed nothing more than Fred and Ginger, a whirlwind of spats and cravats wending their way across the floor in flawless harmony. In the sixth of their ten films as partners, they had hit their stride, bonded by the unalloyed trust of performers accustomed to one another’s rhythms. It’s somewhat rich that they play strangers who have never danced together — he’s a gamblin’ man with fancy feet, she’s a big-city dance teacher he’s fixing to swindle — in a scene that’s entirely reliant on their alchemical rapport. Old hand Astaire pretends to be a newbie whipped into shape by Rogers’s tutelage for the sake of her onlooking boss, and for a fleeting instant, even she looks shocked by how well they go together. Which, yes, she does backwards and in heels.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83iy0049396113rpk3pu@published>4. “Stayin’ Alive,” <a data-vars-anchor-text="Saturday Night Fever" href=#>Saturday Night Fever</a> (1977)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw835e002v3961m46ax3mm@published data-word-count=121>You can indeed tell by the way he uses his walk that he’s a woman’s man. (No time to talk.) As Bay Ridge bronco Tony Manero, Travolta projects self-assurance as we human beings can only wish to do, the very picture of machismo as he struts down the sidewalk in his eye-catching threads. It’s all too put-together to be real, and Tony’s sartorial swagger belies his dead-end job and cramped cohabitation with his family. On the illuminated proving ground of the discotheque quadrangle, however, he can pass as his most aspirational self and rule like an emperor. Men want to be him, women want to be with him, and viewers want to spend eternity in thrall of a peerless charm offensive.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnyw83j3004c39617oirpdbr@published>3.

The fable of a ballerina (Moira Shearer) who found an enchanted pair of slippers and fell prey to the nefarious Shoemaker (Léonide Massine) provides the brain trust known as The Archers with magnificent scaffolding on which to hang their collection of Impressionist influences. They form the link between museum-favored masters such as Monet and Degas and New Hollywood upstarts like Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese, erecting a gleaming rainbow bridge between stuffy high art and spectacle-oriented pop cinema.

Director Claire Denis drops the needle on Corona’s signature club-crusher for the Mauvais Sang star’s other legendary dance scene, another sudden release of repressed verve. Except this time around, the cinematography traffics in stasis instead of motion, tidily corresponding to a deeper reversal at play: Levant unleashed all his rambunctiousness in the earlier role, but as Foreign Legion Sergeant Galoup, he can’t bring himself to reckon with his sublimated homosexual urges. He and his men must channel their pent-up libidos into masculine activities such as wrestling, ironing, and, during the epilogue set in a Djiboutian party hall unstuck from the narrative timeline, stylized convulsions. Cast out of the military he held so dear, he’ll never be able to face himself.

Donen’s forced-perspective camera games were made possible by a warehouse-sized set that goes on forever and somehow keeps getting bigger as he pulls back and Kelly scurries into the distance. Though Donen and Kelly have nothing but affection for all the artifice, their crowning achievement excels on the merits of that in it which is real. Specifically, the technical prowess of Kelly and his trusty right-hand gal Cyd Charisse, a pillar of truth in a palace of beautiful fibs.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnyw835p002z39615av4pj36@published data-word-count=92>Watch this scene as many times as you like, and you’ll continue to find steps that elude comprehension — how does he pivot from there to there so seamlessly, why doesn’t she fall over while leaning like that, how is it possible that they could anticipate every minuscule quirk of the other’s movements?
