If you don’t already have a go-to BBQ sauce recipe up your sleeve, let me introduce you to mine. This easy homemade BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy, with a smoky, savory kick from spices like cumin and smoked paprika. It comes together super quickly (we’re talking 20 minutes on the stove!), and a batch will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks. We love having it on hand to jazz up whatever we’re grilling! Homemade BBQ Sauce Recipe Ingredients After living in Austin for many years, I’ll be the first to admit that BBQ…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This burrito recipe happens to be vegan, but you don’t have to be vegan to love it. It’s easy to make, it’s flavorful and fresh, and you can even meal prep it if you want to get ahead on lunch or dinner. The hearty filling consists of Spanish rice, seasoned black beans, guacamole, pickled onions, and veggies. Take it over the top with a side of salsa for dipping! Below, I’ll walk you through how to make this vegan burrito recipe, offer tips for how to store it, and share some tasty variations. It’s my favorite burrito recipe, vegan or…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Welcome to how to fold a burrito 101! If you’re anything like me, you’ve rolled many a disappointing burrito in your day. Maybe the tortilla tore, maybe the filling spilled out the end of the burrito as you ate… Whatever happened, you didn’t end up folding—or eating—the Chipotle-worthy burrito of your dreams. I’ve been there. But a few years ago, after a particularly memorable burrito mess (please, don’t ask!), I finally figured out how to roll a burrito so that it wouldn’t leak or split. As it turns out, the process is super easy—you can find my step-by-step guide below.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Why buy taco seasoning in a packet when you can make your own?! This homemade taco seasoning recipe uses basic spices that you likely have in your pantry already, and you can stir it together in less than 5 minutes. Once you learn how to make it, you’ll never get the store-bought stuff again! One of the biggest reasons I make my own taco seasoning is that I can tweak the balance of flavors. The recipe below yields a blend I love—it’s savory and smoky with a subtle kick of heat. When you make it, don’t hesitate to adjust it…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I’ve eaten Spanish rice at Mexican restaurants countless times, but it wasn’t until this year that I started making this Spanish rice recipe at home. Today’s post is a PSA: if you’re not already making homemade Spanish rice, it’s time to start. You’re seriously missing out! Spanish rice, also called Mexican rice or arroz rojo, is a type of rice pilaf cooked with onions and garlic, tomatoes, peppers, and spices. It’s commonly eaten throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, and it’s the perfect side dish for a simply cooked protein or Mexican fare like tacos and enchiladas. The…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Salad recipes are my favorite way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce—fruits and veggies that taste so good on their own that it doesn’t take much to make them into a delicious meal. On cold winter nights, I like to brighten up our table with a colorful mix of root veggies and hearty greens. On beautiful, warm days when I’d rather be outside than in the kitchen, summer salads are the perfect lunch or dinner: they’re simple to toss together, but they’re super flavorful nonetheless. Whether you want to add more plant-based meals to your diet or are simply looking to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>We’re heading into a long weekend—let’s make buckwheat pancakes! These beauties are light and fluffy, and the buckwheat flour gives them a wonderful nutty flavor. Saturday morning, here we come. 🙂 While many buckwheat pancake recipes call for a mix of buckwheat flour and all-purpose flour or whole wheat flour, I use 100% buckwheat in mine. I love that you can really taste the buckwheat this way. It’s earthy and nutty, and it makes these pancakes a unique treat. They’re also naturally gluten-free, because despite its name, buckwheat isn’t actually related to wheat. You can read more on that below,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If I’m not eating summer strawberries straight out of the carton, I’m using them to make this strawberry compote recipe. It calls for just 4 ingredients, cooks up in 20 minutes, and tastes so good that I could eat half a batch straight off a spoon. This strawberry compote is lightly sweet, bright with lemon, and bursting with fresh strawberry flavor. It’s thick enough to spread on toast like jam, but it also makes a great topping for ice cream, pancakes, waffles, and Greek yogurt…the possibilities here are endless. And good news! Even though this strawberry sauce is AMAZING with…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I make this hibiscus tea recipe at least once a week. In the winter, I enjoy it hot, the ruby red drink reviving me when the weather is cold and gray. In the summer, I crave it iced. On a warm day, its bold, tart flavor is intensely refreshing. I’m sharing my go-to method for how to make hibiscus tea below. If you’ve never tried it, I hope you’ll give it a go! It’s delicious and SO simple to make. This hibiscus tea recipe calls for 2 ingredients and requires under 5 minutes of hands-on prep. Plus, it has some…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This potato salad recipe is hands down the BEST I’ve tried. It’s creamy, it’s tangy, and it’s flecked with savory herbs, crunchy celery, and (optional, but delicious) hard-boiled eggs. I’ll be bringing it to every cookout and BBQ we attend this summer. This potato salad recipe is so tasty that I can’t get enough! It’s essentially the classic potato salad that appeared at every picnic and potluck throughout my childhood, but it has a few key twists. First, I add diced dill pickles for crunch, and I also mix a splash of pickle brine into the creamy mayo and mustard…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This mango salad recipe is everything I want in a summer side dish. It has a short list of fresh ingredients, you can toss it together in 20 minutes, and it’s sooo bright and refreshing. I love the variety of textures and flavors in this dish. The mango is sweet and slippery, and when you bite into it, it’s almost creamy. I accent it with crisp bell peppers and red onion, plus jalapeños for a kick of heat. Peanuts add crunch, and a zesty lime dressing ties the whole thing together.
