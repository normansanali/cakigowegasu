He's a drug dealer driving a red sports car in Stapleton, Staten Island, where the series begins after a late-night shooting at Ghostface Killah's house.</p><p>Let's say that — without revealing spoilers — the beloved drug dealer has quite the arc over the course of the season's first couple of episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>But while most of the characters on Wu-Tang: An American Saga are based on real members of Wu-Tang, their families, and friends, many viewers are wondering whether the same applies to Jah Son.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And it's hard to get to the bottom of that question because there isn't too much information around about anyone named Jah Son, as far as the Wu-Tang Clan goes. After all, judging from Hulu's promotional materials surrounding the show, only seven of the nine Wu-Tang members are set to appear.</p><p>And while Masta Killa and Cappadonna might not make an appearance in An American Saga, many viewers think that Jah Son is a fictional recreation of Cappa. "Okay episode three of the Wu-Tang series," one fan explains on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. "There's a trippy alternate timeline sequence that images what would have happened if a guy named Jah Son had survived a shooting [sic]."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"He completely replaces Cappadonna, in a show produced by other members of Wu-Tang. Very on-brand Cappa," he writes. Another continues unpacking the series' third episode, "All in Together Now," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">adding</a>, "In the Sliding Doors opening, we see what might've happened if Jah Son was still around."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"You can see this alternate version of Ghostface's Ironman album that features the same cover, but Bobby and Jah Son have been swapped out for Rae and Cap."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who plays Jah Son in Wu-Tang: An American Saga?</h2><p>Jah Son is played by 22-year-old Dominican-born Jorge Lendeborg Jr.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, he's starred as Memo in the Transformers prequel Bumblebee, Spiderman: Far From Home, and the critically acclaimed Love, Simon. But for emerging star Jorge, this is just the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Going forward, yeah, I'm mindful, man," he said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Film</a>. "I got to make sure that I show myself in the best light. Now that people are starting to recognize me just because I've planted myself in pretty good films, I would say, popular films. I got to make sure that the work continues to push forward, to be better, to grow."</p><p>Luckily, Wu-Tang: An American Saga does the job of propelling Jorge's career further into the limelight.</p><p>Stream Wu-Tang: An American Saga week after week on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66pedKopWavpWLBorrGZpinZZGisrO1wpqlZquRnK4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alofa-time-pleads-guilty-to-first-degree-murder.html><span>←</span><span>Alofa Time Pleads Guilty To First Degree Murder</span></a>
