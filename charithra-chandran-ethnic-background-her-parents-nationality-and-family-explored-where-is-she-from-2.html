But, given that her roots are attached to Tamil Nadu, India, she must be a Tamilian.</p><p>Charithra loves to flex her culture and norms on her social media, as we can see her flaunting sarees and ‘Gajras’ to look as much South Indian as she can in ceremonies.</p><p>And fans indeed love seeing her that way.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-charithra-chandran-parents-palanichamy-chandran-and-shanthi-chandran></span>Meet Charithra Chandran Parents: Palanichamy Chandran and Shanthi Chandran<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Charithra Chandran is the only daughter of her father, Palanichamy Chandran, and her mother, Shanthi Chandran.</p><p>They both are doctors but split when their daughter was only two-years-old.</p><p>She lived most of her childhood with her father and teenage with her mother. And, now lives independently.</p><p>However, she never fails to upload pictures of her parents, and family on her&nbsp;social media.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=to-what-nationality-does-she-belong></span>To What Nationality Does She Belong?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Charithra Surya Chandran was born on 17 January 1997 in Perth, Scotland.

And, they are portrayed in such a way that people are calling her pregnant.</p><p>Pulling anyone’s leg or trolling for having stretch marks is completely absurd as it is one of the essential parts of being a woman.</p><p>But in reality, the actress is neither pregnant nor has visible stretch marks. Hence, it is only a rumor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-charithra-chandran-from></span>Where Is Charithra Chandran From?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born in Perth, Scotland, Charithra Chandran is an English actress carrying Indian descent.</p><p>As mentioned above, following her parents’ split, she went to live with her grandparents in Tamil Nadu, India.
