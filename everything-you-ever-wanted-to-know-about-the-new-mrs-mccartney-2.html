They were first seen out and about in the Hamptons, New York in 2007.</p><p>Nancy was born to Myron and Arlene Shevell, and has a brother named Jon and a sister named Susan. Her father owns a reputable and highly lucrative trucking firm in the area named New England Motor Freight.</p><p>She married Bruce Blakeman, a lawyer, in 1984 and together they had a son, Arlen, who is now 19.</p><p>After 23 years, she and Blakeman divorced. It was said that their breakup and divorce was amicable.</p><p>Her meeting with McCartney in 2007 wasn’t the first time she and McCartney had crossed paths. She and Blakeman knew Paul and his first wife Linda from the times they would visit the Hamptons where Linda’s family lived.</p><p><a href=#><span><strong>Is the third time a charm for McCartney?

When the news broke that Shevell and McCartney were dating, Walters explained, “I love her very much. She’s my second cousin. Her mother, who died, was my first cousin and I have been very close to this young woman.”</p><p>She serves as Vice President of Administration at Shevell Group of Companies, LLC and is Vice President of Administration of The Shevell Group/Carrier Industries Inc.</p><p>The new Mrs. McCartney was also named Chairperson of the Capital Construction Committee of the Metropolitan Transportaion Authority in 2004.</p><p>She is a breast cancer survivor and reports have surfaced that she and Linda were good friends, but that hasn’t been confirmed yet.</p><p>McCartney popped the question to Shevell on May 6 of this year and the two were married on October 6 at Marylebone Town Hall in London. He was married there once before to first wife Linda in 1969.</p><p>Out of respect for Shevell’s Jewish heritage, the twosome attended a synagogue service the evening before.</p><p>Photo Credit: WENN</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpocGRohnqFjp6tnqqpqbWqusZmsKitXZrDpr6MsJinrJWZerW7jKSlqK9dlq%2BwwdNmq6GdXaOyuHnMq6pmpZOYrrPAzZ6wZmpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-cheese-sticks-need-to-be-refrigerated-html.html><span>←</span><span>Do cheese sticks need to be refrigerated?</span></a>
