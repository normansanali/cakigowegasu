In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, sin eaters were required to visit the dying and consume a slice of bread thoroughly soaked through with their sins. (Some believe that sin eating dates all the way back to the Middle Ages.)</p><p>The sin eater would then wash down the horrors with a wooden bowl of ale. They received some financial compensation for their services, after which they were banished from the property. Abuse would often be shouted at them, and physical threats weren't uncommon.</p><p>Sin eaters are often described in folklore as heretics going against the official dictum of the church. By agreeing to consume other people's sins, they helped other people escape purgatory. The catch? They had no chance of going anywhere near heaven.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>According to outlets like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vice</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gizmodo</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlas Obscura</a>, sin eating carried a social stigma. Those who agreed to take on the profession were likely in need of money. Alas, it was widely believed that the sin eater would become worse each time they consumed someone's sins. As such, they were perceived as the accumulation of the transgressive deeds the parishioners committed during their lifetime.</p><p>Sin eaters serve as the topic of movies like The Last Sin Eater and novels like The Sin Eater by Megan Campisi. Joseph Downes' The Mountain Decameron, a collection of folklore tales originally published in 1836, and Ingrid Harris's The Gift of Suffering, a book published in 2007, mention sin eaters too.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I forgive ye, Hiram.
