<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>The Legend Of Vox Machina Season 2 Updates, News &amp;amp; Story Set-Up</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Vox Machina has saved Tal’Dorei from certain destruction, albeit temporarily – here’s everything we know about&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>The Legend of Vox Machina</strong></a> season 2. The real life story of <a href=#>Vox Machina’s creation</a> is a long way from conventional. Beginning as a humble game of&nbsp;Dungeons & Dragons among voice actors, Vox Machina found an online following under the Critical Role moniker, before a Kickstarter campaign to create an animated series attained runaway success. Amazon then picked up the baton, bringing&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina to a mainstream audience.</p><p>The Legend of Vox Machina season 1 begins prior to Critical Role’s streaming campaign, with the titular&nbsp;travelers tackling a terrifying blue dragon. Their success earns (temporary) favor among Emon’s leadership, but then along come the Briarwoods to stir up trouble.&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina‘s debut season ends with the gang helping Percy reclaim Whitestone, sparing the realm a messy end at the hands of the Whispered One. Everybody lives happily ever after… for a bit.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Legend Of Vox Machina Already Planted Seeds For Mighty Nein’s Campaign</a></span></p><p>Streaming viewership numbers are notoriously difficult to discern compared to network TV ratings, but we can at least say&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina has enjoyed acclaim from&nbsp;D&D&nbsp;veterans and tabletop newbies alike. How does this bode for&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina season 2?</p><h2>The Legend Of Vox Machina Season 2 Renewal</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Thanks&nbsp;to its existing popularity (a multi-million dollar Kickstarter campaign probably helped too),&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina found itself in a uniquely favorable position even before premiering. When Amazon&nbsp;confirmed&nbsp;<a href=#>The Legend of Vox Machina‘s streaming rights</a> had been purchased for Prime Video in November 2019, the&nbsp;deal specified&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina season 2 was green-lit, comprising another 12 episodes, and bringing the total to 24.</p><h2>How The Legend Of Vox Machina Ending Sets Up Season 2</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Having that&nbsp;second season guarantee meant&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina&nbsp;could&nbsp;pack its season 1 finale with foreshadowing and setup. Most obviously,&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina season 1 ends with the cliffhanger arrival of four dragons known as the Chroma Conclave,&nbsp;triggering the next arc of Critical Role’s campaign. We can probably&nbsp;assume Emon gets toasted, and Vox Machina will spend most of season 2 on dragon-slaying duties, as these scaly friends of <a href=#>Brimscythe (General Krieg’s dragon transformation)</a> wreak havoc. Vex also hints&nbsp;that Anna Ripley, Percy’s ex-torturer, will play a role in Vox Machina’s season 2 adventures,&nbsp;after she escaped the group during season 1’s climactic battle. Grog’s new sword feels suspicious too. Something about&nbsp;a&nbsp;dark blade with a penchant for drinking blood (and in Grog’s hands, no less) feels a bit unsafe…</p><p>Potentially the most significant omen in&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina‘s season 1 finale is Delilah Briarwood’s botched Whispered One summoning, and the Spinning Orb of Death left underneath Whitestone. These details tease Vecna – the final villain of Critical Role’s Vox Machina campaign – having a larger role in season 2. With the Chroma Conclave in play, however, you’d imagine Vecna is being eyed for season 3 or beyond, should&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina reach that milestone.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Legend of Vox Machina Is A Fantasy Version Of The Boys (& That’s A Good Thing)</a></span></p><h2>The Legend Of Vox Machina Season 2 Predicted Release Date</h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Amazon hasn’t yet announced a release date for&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina season 2. The good news is that&nbsp;The Legend of Vox Machina‘s follow-up season was confirmed&nbsp;over 2 years ago, meaning some degree of production has surely been completed already. Development isn’t starting from scratch, as happens with most TV shows, which wait&nbsp;to see how season 1 goes down before making any decisions&nbsp;about the future. The bad news is COVID. The pandemic delayed&nbsp;<a href=#>The Legend of Vox Machina season 1</a> from its original 2020 release date to 2022, which could mean season 2 remains some way out. As a tentative prediction, it would be reasonable to expect&nbsp;<strong>The Legend of Vox Machina</strong> season 2 in late 2022/early 2023.</p><p><span class=next-single>More:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Legend Of Vox Machina Ending Explained & Shocking Season 2 Set-Up</a></span></p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>Walking Dead Just Gave Negan His Comic Ending (Without Carl)</span></strong></p><p><strong class=section-sub-title>About The Author</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Craig-2021.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><strong class=bio-title><br>Craig Elvy<br><span class=amount>(3452 Articles Published)</span><br></strong><p>Craig first began contributing to Screen Rant in 2016, several years after graduating college, and has been ranting ever since, mostly to himself in a darkened room.
