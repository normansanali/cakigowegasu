Has she remarried or started seeing someone new? We’ll discuss a number of fascinating facts about her work, romantic relationships, kids, and other topics in this post.</p><h2><span id=Actor_Alfonso_Ribeiro8217s_ex-wife_is_Robin_Stapler>Actor Alfonso Ribeiro’s ex-wife is Robin Stapler.</span></h2><p>As we previously mentioned, Robin was wed to director and actor Alfonso Ribeiro. On January 20, 2002, the ex-couple tied the knot in a stunning ceremony.</p><p>It was on the sets of In the House in 1999 when Robin and Alfonso first became together. Right from their first meeting, the couple fell in love. Well, Ribero apparently went out to dinner with Stapler the same evening after making the initial contact.</p><p>As they started dating, things quickly grew romantic for both of them. Sadly, though, their romance didn’t endure very long. The couple, who had been married for around five years, filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court on August 9th, claiming they couldn’t agree on anything. The date of their divorce was set for February 19, 2007.</p><h2><span id=She_and_her_only_daughter_share_joint_custody>She and her only daughter share joint custody.</span></h2><p>Robin Ribeiro is the mother of Sienna Ribeiro, who was born out of her marriage to Alfonso. On October 7, 2002, the ex-couple welcomed their only child. They did, however, share joint custody of their child following their divorce.</p><p>Sienna is eighteen years old as of right now. She has gained a lot of popularity on TikTok and has acted in a few short films, one of which is called Unwritten. In actuality, Robin’s daughter Sienna is descended from her father’s connections and has two half-brothers, Alfonso Lincoln and Anders Reyn, as well as a half-sister, Ava.</p><p>Following their divorce, Robin’s ex-husband wed Angela Unkrich.</p><p>Following a nearly 6-year divorce from Robin, her former spouse Alfonso entered into a second marriage. He wed Angela Unkrich this time. On October 13, 2012, about three months after their engagement, they were married.</p><p>Angela, nevertheless, is an actor as well. She has acted in films and television shows, including Home & Family (2012) and Get Me Out of Here! (2002). Ava, Anders, and Alfonso are the couple’s three children from their marriage. It’s said that they have a wonderful life together.</p><h2><span id=Actress_Robin_Stapler>Actress Robin Stapler</span></h2><p>Stapler is not just a fitness instructor; she is an actor as well.

There are no indications from her social media posts that she is in a romantic relationship of any kind.</p><p>She doesn’t seem to be married or in a relationship.
