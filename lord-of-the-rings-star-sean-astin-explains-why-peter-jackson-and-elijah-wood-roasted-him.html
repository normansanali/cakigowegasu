He joked that The Lord of the Rings “blew,” by comparison, since he had to put on weight to properly portray the role of Samwise Gamgee.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>However, the weight Astin put on was apparently not enough to satisfy director Peter Jackson to the point that Jackson would openly discourage the actor from exercising and eating healthy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/death-note-cosplay.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DBZ-cosplay.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/moon-knight-cosplay-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DSC01893.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DSC01894.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/bobs-burger-cosplay.jpg><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>Astin recounted one time in which he was photographed by a paparazzi leaving a gym in New Zealand’s capital, Wellington, with one of the crew members of the film. When the photo made the front page of a prominent New Zealand newspaper, Astin said he returned to work the next day with Jackson examining the photo on a monitor. Jackson, according to Astin’s account, then told a crew member, “More loillies for Mr. Astin, please,” while shooting the actor a dirty look simply for exercising.</p><p data-characters=110 data-current-count=110 data-injectable=false>However, another instance of being roasted on the set was for the exact opposite reason than Jackson’s.</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>“The best was in the Osgiliath Ruins, when we get that great speech and Frodo is lost and we fall down the stairs, and he takes Sting and he’s out of his mind, he’s going to kill… he’s got the Sting at Sam’s throat,” Astin said, referencing a scene from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers in which Wood’s Frodo, under the spell of the One Ring, takes his sword known as Sting to Astin’s throat at the climax of an altercation. You can find a clip of the scene below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>“The camera’s here and Elijah’s there and I’m like on my back, you know, and Peter’s like, ‘put [the sword] under his chin.’ And Elijah goes, ‘which one?'” Astin explained, as the fans that packed the ballroom in what may have been the most popular panel at the con burst into laughter.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>In all fairness, Astin said he did not believe Wood was actually trying to hurt his feelings, but was genuinely asking Jackson where exactly he wanted him to place the blade, being the professional actor he was.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8uoqZ1ln5t6tbTEZqmippeoerTAwKtkrJ2Ro3qiv9OipWadqKW5orXNrGSwoKlivabAxKtko5mToMCwuoyapZ1llaG2q63HZq6op5Riv7Ct0q2cnWWYnrpw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelis-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Kelis's Husband, Mike Mora, Has Died at Age 37 Details on the Tragedy</span></a>
