The provision of the Bible is to love God through His son, Jesus Christ. Throughout the Bible, there is a display of God’s mightiness, mercifulness, graciousness and power.</p><p>His work of creation shows His mighty power over everyone and everything in heaven and on earth. His love for humans and His creations is incomparable and indispensable. The Bible says in Psalm 145:8-9 “The Lord is gracious and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Powerful Verses&nbsp;About Unity In The Bible</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>Differences Between Grace and Mercy</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The Greek word mostly used for ‘mercy’ is eleos which means compassion or pity and ‘grace’ is also, charis which means favor. Grace and Mercy are two different things altogether.</p><p>Mercy is an act of withholding punishment for someone who deserves it but grace is an act of endowing disadvantaged favour. The Bible tells us that, God does not punish(hell) us for our wrongdoing even if we deserve it. His grace also gives us the gift we do not deserve (heaven).</p><p>Therefore, we all need God’s grace and mercy at any time in our lives. Grace takes us to reconciliation and mercy leads us to the way it is forgiveness.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><strong>God’s Grace And Mercy In The New Testament</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Saul was a persecutor, yet God converted him to become Paul, the apostle of Christ, the author of nearly half of the New Testament.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Peter was idiosyncrasy and denied Jesus, yet God used him to preach the gospel and about 3,000 were saved.</p><p>Thomas was a doubter, yet God used him to preach the Gospel in India and possibly Indonesia (according to traditions),</p><p>Mary Magdalene was demon-possessed, yet God graciously gave her a wonderful chance of being the first witness of the risen Christ.</p><p>Martha was restless, yet God also allowed her to be among the first witnesses of the resurrection of Christ (and of Lazarus, her brother).</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>5 Psalms of Lament From The Bible</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><strong>God’s Grace and Mercy in the Bible&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Grace and Mercy are mostly mistaken in the New Testament concept. The two words have made a significant appearance in the Holy Bible.</p><p>The Bible has given us accounts of using imperfect people to accomplish His works. There is a vast number of examples of God’s grace and mercy in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. David is the most prominent example: he was called “a man after God’s own heart” despite his sins.</p><p>David killed, fornicated and lusted. Abraham also lied, Rahab was a commoner, and Moses was doubtful and stubborn yet, they were all used by God to accomplish His purpose.</p><p>God was faithful and His promises never failed (Exodus 34:6, Deuteronomy 4:31, 7:9, Lamentations 3:22-23, Numbers 6:24-26).</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDAx55km6GSobakrctmm6Kelpq%2FprrCnqpmmpWpxKaxzWaeq5mTmnqiusNmpJ6qk658</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./767928-sir-apologizes-for-kai-cenat-tweet-hip-hop-news.html><span>←</span><span>SiR Apologizes For Misogynistic Tweet About Kai Cenat Stream</span></a>
