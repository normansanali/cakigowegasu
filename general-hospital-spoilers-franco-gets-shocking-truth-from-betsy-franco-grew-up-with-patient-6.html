Or could it?</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/gh-besty-franco.jpg alt="General Hospital Spoilers: Franco Gets Shocking Truth From Betsy - Franco Grew Up With Patient 6" width=500 height=278 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The image blew Franco’s mind, and he wanted to find out the details surrounding the image before he jumped to conclusions. Betsy told him that it’s time she told him the truth about his past. General Hospital spoilers state that Betsy seemed to fight back the tears as she told him that it’s time he learned the truth about his upbringing.</p><p>Franco pointed to the picture and said, “Let’s start with something really simple. That kid right here is Jason Morgan! Am I correct?”</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/gh-jason-morgan-franco-pic.jpg alt="General Hospital Spoilers: Franco Gets Shocking Truth From Betsy - Franco Grew Up With Patient 6" width=500 height=233 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Betsy cries and tells him that she isn’t sure she should be talking about this. Betsy warned him not to go looking for answers that he isn’t prepared to hear. She urged him to drop it and pretend that he never saw the picture. For Franco, that is not an option. General Hospital spoilers suggest that the other boy in Franco’s picture will turn out to be Steve Burton AKA Patient 6 at the clinic.</p><p>Will Franco find out his past connection to Jason Morgan? Will Betsy tell him the whole truth?
