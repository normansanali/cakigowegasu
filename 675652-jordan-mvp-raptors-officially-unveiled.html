This list includes the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Air Jordan</a> 6, Air Jordan 7, and Air Jordan 8. Consequently, you can deduce these are an homage to Michael Jordan's first three titles and Finals MVPs. Although, the way in which these shoes are combined is quite tasteful. This is a breath of fresh air for fans who are otherwise repulsed by hybrid shoes.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Throughout the last few months, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">we have seen a plethora of these colorways get teased online</a>. Overall, it is easy to see why. This is a brand-new shoe and fans want to get their hands on them. Furthermore, the best way to build hype for a new shoe is by coming out with all sorts of colorways. With the Jordan MVP getting new releases very soon, Jumpman has just blessed us with some new official images. Below, you can find the new "Raptors" color scheme.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-raptors-jordan-mvp>"Raptors" Jordan MVP</h2></span><p>Image via Nike</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As you can see from these images, the "Raptors" influence here is very obvious. Firstly, the upper is covered in black suede. Secondly, there is some purple and red throughout the rest of the sneaker. This appears in places such as the midsole, tongue, inner lining, and even the overlay near the back of the shoe. When put together, you get a shoe that is definitely going to turn some heads. Moreover, it's just clean and a nice reference to the 90s.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-more-photos>More Photos</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At the time of writing this, the Jordan MVP "Raptors" does not yet have a release date. However, it is expected to be dropping very soon for a price of $165 USD. If you love the Toronto Raptors, then these kicks are absolutely going to be for you.
