His cause of death has yet to be revealed. Khosrow leaves behind his wife of 47 years, Caryl, his two living children Tanya, Nikki, his son-in-law Eddie and his five grandchildren (Marissa, Zahra, Alexis, Chloe, and Niko). He is also noted as having a close bond with his nephews, Page and Jian Magen, who previously produced the 2014 documentary The Sheik. His eldest daughter, Marissa, was tragically murdered in 2003.</p><p>As the statement begins:</p><p>“Today, we gather with heavy hearts to bid farewell to a true legend, a force of nature, and an iconic figure who left an incredible mark on the world of professional wrestling. It is with great sadness that we share the news of the passing of The Iron Sheik, but we also take solace in knowing that he departed this world peacefully, leaving behind a legacy that will endure for generations to come.”</p><p>The Sheik became the only Iranian WWE (or WWF, as it used to be known) Champion in the organization’s history when he bested Bob Backlund in the ring at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 26, 1983. He held onto the title for a month before he himself lost to Hulk Hogan, in what remains one of the most famous matches ever, thereby launching Hogan’s wrestling career. The rival between Hogan and the Sheik continued throughout the decade, ensuring Khosrow went down as one of the WWE’s most memorable villainous characters. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005.</p><p>Outside of the ring, however, Khosrow was “known for his humor, his larger-than-life personality, and his ability to connect with fans on a personal level,” according to the aforementioned statement. “Throughout his career, The Iron Sheik became a cultural phenomenon,” it continues, “transcending the realm of professional wrestling to become a pop culture icon.”</p><p>Rest in peace, Sheik. Our thoughts are with his family at this sad time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEs7HSraOippdiuaazxKebZqCfqMCmtc1moqGno6e8uHnApaBmrpGvtrO1jJqimmWknbJutdGopWarmJq2rHnPmqqsnaNirrit2GaYrWWRnLJuhJBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-david-herman-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is David Herman Dating Now</span></a>
