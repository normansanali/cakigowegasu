The date range is from November 23, 1999 to January 9, 2024. Michael McKay is extremely cherished by his parents, Daniel and Mary McKay. Daniel and Dominick will miss their dear brother, who will also be missed by a large number of aunts, cousins, and friends.</p><p>The warmth and friendliness that Michael exuded could fill an entire room, and his drive to make other people successful was unparalleled. In addition to being the valedictorian of Wolcott school, he graduated with honors from Mount Carmel high school, where he participated in both baseball and soccer, attended Arizona State University, and was now enrolled at Purdue University during his time there.</p><p>Michael acquired a passion for bartending and creating new drinks while he was still in school. If you were fortunate enough to have the opportunity to experience his service, you would notice that this passion was the primary focus of his work. He was a bright spot in the life of a great number of individuals and had a constant desire to make you laugh. All those whose lives he touched will miss him tremendously. At the Tews-Ryan Funeral Home, located at 18230 Dixie Highway in Homewood, there will be a visitation and funeral ceremony on Sunday, January 14, beginning at one o’clock and continuing until the time of the service at 5:30 o’clock. Please visit tews-ryanfh.com or call 708-798-5300 for any additional information you may require.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwucicn5qdnGK6pLfAsmSompmpwqK%2B2Garoaeio8Gwuoyio2almZi1orHLZqSco5Gueqmt0mabop2UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./krizia-vega-net-worth-238314.html><span>←</span><span>Krizia Vega Net Worth</span></a>
