But were the pair ever engaged?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Were Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson ever engaged?</h2><p>RPats and KStew started seeing each other in 2009, just one year after Twilight premiered in theaters. The pair dated for three years and were one of the iconic celeb couplings of the time before splitting in 2012 amid a scandal that Kristen cheated on Robert with married director Rupert Sanders.</p><p>As recently as 2019, Kristen still talked positively of Robert, despite their split, calling him "the best."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p><strong>"</strong>We were together for years, that was my first [love]," she told Howard Stern.</p><p>The pair were never engaged, but Howard asked Kristen if she would've married Robert had he ever proposed, to which she stuttered out, "No — I wanted to."</p><p>She admitted that she went into the relationship very seriously and confessed that she considers marrying most of the people she's dated. Even though Howard told her falling in love with him on set was not a good idea, she said, "There was nothing I could do."</p><p><strong>"</strong>I don’t know. I’m not a super duper traditionalist, but at the same time, like yeah," she said. "Every relationship I’ve ever been in, I thought that was it. I’ve never like casually — maybe one or two, OK, I’m not giving everyone that due. I’ve never really been the most casual person."</p><p>It was during this interview that she admitted to already planning a proposal for her now-fiancée, Dylan Meyer, who she had only started seeing months prior.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Despite things not working out between her and Robert, she revealed that part of the reason things became so messy was due to how public their relationship was. She said she wanted to do things like hold hands with him in public, but she didn't like that it would be making the details of their relationship so public.</p><p>"It’s so weird actually being honest about this it’s been so heavily consumed, and I have this fear that people would assume that maybe I’m like, it’s kind of attention-y ‘oh cool you are still pushing that narrative’ or whatever and it’s like no, I’ve actually never been able to say what happened because I was so self-conscious about seeming like an attention-seeker," she said of their split.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dylan Meyer (@spillzdylz)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kristen is now engaged to actress and screenwriter Dylan Meyer.</h2><p>While things may not have worked out between Kristen and Rob, the pair have <a href=#>each moved on</a> and are happy with their respective people. Kristen even shared with Howard Stern on Nov. 1 that she and her <a href=#>girlfriend of two years</a>, <a href=#>Dylan Meyer</a>, are engaged.</p><p>The pair were first spotted together in August 2019, and by the end of that same year, she was gushing about how excited she was to one day propose to Dylan.</p><p>"We're marrying, we're totally gonna do it," she said to the radio host, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "I wanted to be proposed to, so I think I very distinctly carved out what I wanted and she nailed it. It was really cute, she did very well. We're marrying, it's happening."</p><p>Congrats to the happy couple!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLKzsYykqaKrpJq7br%2FTnq6aqqRirq%2BwjKumm52iqXqxrdOtoKern6N6prrGmp6enA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kris-jenner-passes-out-in-car-a-la-lindsay-lohan-after-60th-birthday-2015911.html><span>←</span><span>Kris Jenner Passes Out in Car, a la Lindsay Lohan, After 60th Birthday</span></a>
