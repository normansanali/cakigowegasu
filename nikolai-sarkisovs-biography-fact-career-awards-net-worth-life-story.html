He is also the 74th richest person in Russia and 1088th in the world.</p><p>Mr. Sarkisov, born on June 23, 1968, began accumulating his estimated net worth of $1.35 billion when he worked as an accountant and auditor between 1985 and 1986. From 1986 to 1988, he served in the Armed Forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of USSR. In 1988, he worked as an economist in Avicenna, a company that sells ferrous metals. He started his own business in 1990. He started trading metals and importing construction equipment after he left his job at a Soviet company that exported commodities.</p><p>Nikolai’s brother, billionaire Sergei Sarkisov, owns a successful insurance company, RESO-Garantiva. He later joined Sergei and was in-charged in overseeing its largest clients. Currently, he manages the group’s construction projects. Since 2012, the firm expanded their venture and went to invest in construction projects in the European territory. The Sarkisov brother now owns 63% of RESO-Garantive. The remaining 37% is owned by AXA, a French insurance company.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKaZoLytrchmqpqqm57AsMLSZpmip5enrrG02GadmpukYrCivsSeqWaZp5a%2Fpb%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jKWgn51dqMGwvtho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./melania-trump-2600-burberry-coat-at-2018-easter-egg-roll.html><span>←</span><span>Melania Trump $2,600 Burberry Coat at 2018 Easter Egg Roll</span></a>
