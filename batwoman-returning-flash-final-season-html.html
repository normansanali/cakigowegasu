Now, it appears that Leslie is not done with the Arrowverse quite yet, as she has recently been cast in a secret role in the upcoming final season of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Flash</a>, according to a report by <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>. Even though Javicia Leslie has signed on to the ninth and final season of The Flash, there are currently no known details about the type of role the actor will play in the series.</p><p>It should probably be assumed that Javicia Leslie will reprise her role as Ryan Wilder, aka Batwoman, in&nbsp;The Flash&nbsp;as it has only been a few months since her series went off the air. The actor appeared as her character from Batwoman in a 2021 episode of The Flash entitled “Armageddon, Part 3” as well as its follow-up episode, “Armageddon, 4.” Filming for the ninth season of&nbsp;The Flash&nbsp;is currently underway, and the final season of the series is due to be released on The CW sometime in 2023.</p><p>Batwoman&nbsp;began its three-season run in 2019 with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ruby Rose</a>&nbsp;in the leading role as Kate Kane, the cousin of Bruce Wayne, aka&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman</a>. Rose left the series due to the fact that she believed Warner Bros. Television was not properly supporting the cast and crew, citing unsafe working conditions on the set of the television show where multiple stunt actors were injured, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>.</p><p>However, Warner Bros. hit back at the actor, claiming that her onset behavior and antics towards other actors forced their hand in letting her go, eventually and controversially not renewing Rose’s contract for the show’s second season.</p><p>When Ruby Rose exited the series, Javicia Leslie was brought in as the new Batwoman under a very different character alias, Ryan Wilder. Wilder had no familial connection to the Wayne empire, so her character was developed as an ex-convict who finds a Batsuit belonging to Kate Kane, and events unfold, which present a way for Wilder to assume the role of Batwoman. The series co-starred Rachel Skarsten, Meagan Tandy, Scottish actor Dougray Scott, Victoria Cartagena, and&nbsp;Riverdale&nbsp;alum Robin Givens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/grant-gustin-the-flash-cw-1-900x506.jpg><p>As&nbsp;Batwoman&nbsp;actor Javicia Leslie prepares for her mysterious arrival in the final season of&nbsp;The Flash, The CW is turning to a possible new set of programming to replace its current onslaught of young adult comic book fare.&nbsp;The Flash&nbsp;will end its ninth season with a 13-episode run with actor&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Gustin</a>&nbsp;continuing to portray the lead role of Barry Allen, aka The Flash.&nbsp;Riverdale&nbsp;will also see its series come to an end in 2023 after seven seasons at the network, with stars KJ Apa, Camila Mendes, Cole Sprouse, and Lili Reinhart saying goodbye to the supernatural horror crime drama they have starred in since 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iakanEsLnAp2SrnaSqv6%2B1zaBkn6SRqLVussinmKVlo5qutLvNZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amara-chehade.html><span>←</span><span>Amara Chehade Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
