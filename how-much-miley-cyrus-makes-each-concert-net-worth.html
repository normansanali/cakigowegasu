She also has to pay for expenses, whether that's a tour bus, private plane, or outfits and stage decorations. Although there is no way of knowing exactly how much she has had to pay for expenses and taxes since this information isn't public, it seems that the costs add up quickly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Miley-Cyrus-Shows-Lightning-Video-From-Inside-Her-Plane-Before-Emergency-Landing.jpg><p><strong>Miley Cyrus's Tour Dates:</strong></p><ul><li>2007-2008: "Best Of Both Worlds Tour"</li><li>2009: "Wonder World Tour"</li><li>2011: "Gypsy Heart Tour"</li><li>2014: "Bangerz Tour"</li><li>2015: "Milky Milky Milk Tour"</li><li>2022: "Attention Tour"</li></ul><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>4:48</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unnamed-6.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Truth About Why Miley Cyrus Regrets Feuding With Sinead O'Connor</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Sinead O'Connor wrote Miley Cyrus an open letter after Miley's "Wrecking Ball" music video, but Miley didn't take it too kindly.</span><p>While Miley Cyrus earns tons of money from her tours, she also throws herself into her live performances, and it sounds like it takes a lot out of her. According to Good Morning America, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyrus talked about her career in some TikTok videos</a>, she described what it feels like when she is on the road.</p><p>Cyrus said:</p><p>"What people don't really understand about touring is the show is only 90 minutes, but that's your life.

In fact, she spent money on the tour because she had many creative ideas for what she wanted each performance to look like. According to PopSugar, Cyrus talked about this specific tour in a video that she posted on TikTok. PopSugar reported that, based on figures from Forbes and Pollstar, <strong>the Bangerz tour grossed $62 million-$70 million</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/miley-cyrus.jpg><p>Cyrus said:</p><p>"I didn't make a dime on this tour because I wanted the tour to be excellent."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tour producers didn't want to shell out any cash for the props that Cyrus had in mind, so she put her own money toward the performances. Cyrus said, "I had big puppets, oversized beds, I came out of my own face on my tongue. This was me and [video director and choreographer] Diane Martel — this was our full vision, once again. She goes like, 'How would you want to end this concert? The show is so big. How do you end it?' And I wanted to end it in a 'Truman Show' reference, so I flew out on a giant hotdog, obviously, and I left through all the clouds and the exit sign the way that Jim Carrey does because I felt like 'The Truman Show' was really a reflection of my life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/miley-cyrus-opened-up-about-why-her-vma-performance-was-a-nightmare-behind-the-scenes-front-deposit-back-the-wall-street-journal-the-wall-street-journal-_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The VMAs Refused To Comment After Miley Cyrus Revealed She Was Mistreated Behind The Scenes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>This behind the scenes incident was just one chapter in Miley Cyrus' long history with the VMAs.</span><p>While it's <strong>unclear how much Cyrus paid for the props on her Bangerz tour</strong>, this is a reminder that sometimes musicians lose some money on tours if they have a lot of expenses. While the Bangerz tour grossed a lot, Cyrus had to pay taxes and expenses, and it sounds like she didn't walk away any wealthier. However, the signer made it clear that she was happy to spend her own money because she was expressing herself artistically.</p><p>In 2023, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus said she wasn't going to tour</a></strong> in the future. If she sticks to this decision, then touring will no longer be a revenue stream for her. According to Deadline, the singer was interviewed by British Vogue and she said, “Not only can’t because can’t is your capability, but my desire. Do I want to live my life for anyone else’s pleasure or fulfillment other than my own?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/miley-cyrus-strange-vocal-fry-is-tiktok-s-viral-obsession-but-here-s-what-really-happened-to-her-speaking-voice.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cyrus added:</p><p>"singing for hundreds of thousands of people isn’t really the thing that I love. There’s no connection. There’s no safety.”</p><p>However, according to The Sun, there's a possibility that Miley Cyrus will have a residency in Las Vegas. As a source explained to the publication, “Miley has been in talks about making her Sin City debut for quite some time. She initially declined an offer from MSG but while she hates life on the road, she still loves being on stage." Cyrus doesn't seem to have confirmed this, so it's unclear whether this will happen. If Cyrus does take this next step in her career, it seems likely that she will add a fortune to her net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIymoKWdqWKwur7UrGSmmZuawG6xwJyfZpufo7CmvtNmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frank-fritz.html><span>←</span><span>Frank Fritz - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Salary, Height, Married, Facts</span></a>
