At one point, more than 7,400 RadioShacks were operational, according to <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>Twice</a>.&nbsp;But that was in 2004, by which point big box stores like Best Buy and Target (and online merchants, particularly Amazon) could sell everything RadioShack did, but for less, and with more variety.&nbsp;</p><p>It's kind of surprising that RadioShack lasted as long as it did, which is the comic through-line of a <a href=#>2007 article</a> that ran in The Onion,&nbsp;positing that newly appointed RadioShack CEO Julian Day couldn't fathom how the company was still kicking.

That's when RadioShack filed for bankruptcy after nearly 100 years in business, according to <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>Forbes</a>.
