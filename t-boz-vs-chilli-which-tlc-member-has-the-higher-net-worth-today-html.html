<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Which TLC Member Has the Higher Net Worth Today?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p id=par-1_95>From Jodeci to the <a href=#>Fugees</a>, the 1990s inundated music fans with a host of uniquely talented bands. Right on cue, the Atlanta-based TLC formed in 1991 and joined the ranks of the best in the business. The trio included Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins, Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, and Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas. They differentiated themselves from other bands with their cutting-edge fashion, catchy hooks, and hip personas. What’s more, TLC had music industry heavy hitters like Dallas Austin, Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, and an L.A. Reid in their corner, and it appeared they were set up for success.</p><p id=par-2_41>Between their individual talents, group chemistry, and A-list connections, TLC was destined to become one of the most influential music groups of all time. Here’s a look at how they shot to superstardom, plus a peek at their <a href=#>total wealth</a> today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TLC-1.jpg><h2><strong>‘Ooooooohhh…On the TLC Tip’</strong></h2><p id=par-3_63>TLC dropped Ooooooohhh…On the TLC Tip with their lead single “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg” in 1992. “Baby-Baby-Baby” followed, along with “What About Your Friends.” “Hat 2 da Back” and “Depend on Myself” were also standout tracks on the album. All three entertainers shared the spotlight and delivered songs that beautifully blended their unique musical gifts. To the delight of music-lovers, that trend would continue with subsequent albums.</p><h2><strong>‘CrazySexyCool’</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_44>TLC’s 1994 album, CrazySexyCool, brought fans crowd-pleasers like Creep, Diggin’ On You, and Red Light Special. And the album included TLC’s most popular hit, Waterfalls, which featured vocal gymnastics from Left Eye with that famous rap verse that karaoke queens and kings have tried in vain to emulate.</p><h2><strong>‘Fanmail’</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-5_30>Next up for TLC was Fanmail in 1999, which boasted more high-profile singles, including Unpretty and No Scrubs. After Fanmail, T-Boz, Left Eye, and Chilli took another break to work on individual projects.</p><h2><strong>‘3D’</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-6_39>TLC returned to the studio to work on their 3D album, but tragedy struck before they could finish. Left Eye passed away after being involved in a car accident in Honduras. Eventually, T-Boz and Chilli completed the album and released it in 2002.</p><h2><strong>‘TLC’</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-5></figure><p id=par-7_39>After an extended hiatus, the self-titled album, TLC, dropped in 2017 with T-Boz and Chilli flaunting their signature unapologetic style. Cuts like “Haters,” “Scandalous,” and “Aye Muthaf*cka” remind music aficionados of why the world fell in love with TLC in the first place.</p><h2>Which TLC member has built more wealth, T-Boz or Chilli?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-6></figure><p id=par-8_47>With three multiplatinum albums and four Grammy Awards, TLC became one of the best-selling and acclaimed girl groups ever, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>. But disputes with management and ensuing bankruptcy filings added complexity to their journey to fame and fortune. So, how much wealth have the members maintained today?</p><p id=par-9_56>At the time of her death, Left Eye was worth an estimated $5 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. After Lopes’ passing, T-Boz and Chilli continued to perform as a duo, engage with fans, and build wealth. Celebrity Net Worth estimates that T-Boz’s net worth amounts to $500,000, while Chilli has amassed a $10 million fortune.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBbq7Os2Svq12Ytaq4y6JksKCZmLVuwMucZKadnZeys3nHmqpmrJiaeqm1xqGcq2WemsFuw86rq6FlpKSxosWNoaumpF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wendell-b-death-cause-and-obituary-what-happened-to-rb-singer.html><span>←</span><span>Wendell B Death Cause And Obituary: What Happened To R&amp;amp;B Singer?</span></a>
