<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>RHOA Recap: Claudia Jordan Flirts With Porsha Williams' Ex-Husband!</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>These girls ain’t loyal! <strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong> finally ends her friendship contract with <strong>NeNe Leakes</strong>, marking the end of an era, while <strong>Claudia Jordan</strong> swoops in on <strong>Porsha Williams</strong>’ ex husband, <strong>Kordell Stewart</strong>. Messy, messy!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Contract = Terminated!</strong></p><p>The girls are back in Atlanta following their tumultuous trip to Puerto Rico, but they still can’t get over the drama that unfolded in paradise. As soon as NeNe lands, she jumps into the waiting arms of husband <strong>Greg Leakes</strong> and tells him all about the trip — and about how she basically bullied new Housewife Claudia.</p><p>“Nae Nae came out?” Greg asks. “I thought you left her at home!”</p><p>Cynthia saw things a little bit differently. At her own home, she tells husband <strong>Peter Thomas</strong> and sister <strong>Malorie</strong> that NeNe is the one who got read this time around — which is true. It’s rare that the Queen Bee is rendered speechless!</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=563 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Cynthia and NeNe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“I don’t even know her, but I like her. I like anybody that stands up to bullies,” Peter says with approval.</p><p>Malorie asks about Cynthia’s season 3 Friendship Contract and jokes that Cynthia should be able to sue for dinner or drinks, since it’s clearly null and void. Cynthia pretends that she doesn’t have the contract anymore — but Malorie finds it in Cynthia’s office, neatly filed away!&nbsp;</p><p>Cynthia promptly runs to the kitchen and sets the contract — as well as her friendship with NeNe — on fire.</p><p>“Friendship Contract is dead,” Cynthia proclaims. “It’s over!”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A Kandi-Koated Addition?</strong></p><p>Baby makin’ music! Newlyweds <strong>Kandi Burruss</strong> and <strong>Todd Tucker</strong> visit Kandi’s OBGYN, Dr. Jackie. She’s been off of birth control for over a year, but the couple is still having problems with getting pregnant.</p><p>“Basically, she thinks it’s me,” Todd tells Dr. Jackie.</p><p>Dr. Jackie directs Todd to the masturbatorium where he…well, you know. She gives the couple a few pointers to further increase their chances, and assures them that they’ll get results back within a few days.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=369 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Kandi Burruss, Riley Burruss, and producer Todd Tucker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In the meantime, Kandi and Todd tend to the kids that they already have — Kandi’s daughter Riley and Todd’s daughter Kaela. Riley’s still adjusting to life as a blended family. Riley wasn’t too receptive towards Kaela when she first moved in, and she’s not too crazy about the prospect of a baby brother or sister, either.</p><p>“I mean, like, you’re a little old,” Riley tells a baby-crazed Kandi.&nbsp;</p><p>Kandi asks Riley and Kaela if they’ve been communicating. Kaela says that she’s tried, but Riley is “standoffish” — partially because of their age difference. Kaela, who’s learning how to drive, predicts that that will change once she has her own set of wheels.</p><p>“Then you’re gonna start talking to her when you ready for her to drive you around,” Kandi agrees. Now that’s sisterly love!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Apollo Tells the Truth</strong></p><p><strong>Phaedra Parks</strong> and <strong>Apollo Nida</strong> are still on the outs, even though the day to turn himself in to start his eight-year prison sentence draws nearer and nearer. Instead of running the streets and hitting the club as he’d been doing during this season, Apollo takes an afternoon to spend time with his two sons, Ayden and Dylan.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=412 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Apollo Nida" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Over frozen yogurt, he tries his best to explain where he’ll be for the next eight years.</p><p>“What happens when Ayden does something that upsets mommy?” Apollo asks Ayden.&nbsp;</p><p>“I get in trouble!” Ayden answers with the smile.&nbsp;</p><p>“What happens with mommy and daddy do something?” Apollo asks. He explains to Ayden that he’ll be in a time out of sorts, but not forever.</p><p>Ayden tells Apollo that he feels “bad” when Apollo isn’t at home. Apollo asks Ayden how he’d feel if he couldn’t come home at all. &nbsp;</p><p>“I’d come to visit you and stay there forever!” Ayden says.&nbsp;</p><p>In his confessional, Apollo admits that he’s had a hard time adjusting to the reality that he’ll be gone for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a difficult pill to swallow,” Apollo says. “It’s almost like I’m in prison, but I’m not in prison.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Another Road Trip!</strong></p><p>Blame it on the alcohol! The girls are on the road again — this time, it’s for the opening of SportsOne, Cynthia and Peter’s new bar in Charlotte, NC. The Beauties (Cynthia, Claudia and <strong>Kenya Moore</strong>) get behind the wheel for the three-hour ride. Though their trip is for one night, Cynthia’s packing for two. She brings a few extra dresses for Claudia since there will be plenty of single men at the party.&nbsp;</p><p>“Claudia is a beautiful girl, but it takes a lot more than a beautiful smile to lock down a man,” Cynthia says in her confessional. “If I don’t know nothing else, mama knows how to get a man!”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=308 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Claudia Jordan, Kenya Moore, Cynthia Bailey" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>While they’re driving, Cynthia calls Phaedra to see if she’ll be joining them. Phaedra politely declines because of a dentist appointment and Bible study…but Kenya hangs up on Phaedra mid-conversation!&nbsp;</p><p>Though she was in the back seat, Kenya provided most of the entertainment during the trip, even acting as DJ for the day and playing “Gone With the Wind Fabulous.” Her antics kept them entertained, sure…but they ended up driving to Charlotte nearly two hours late. Maybe they should’ve twirled there!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Next Mrs. Stewart?</strong></p><p>It’s a small world! <strong>Kordell Stewart</strong>, <strong>Porsha Williams</strong>’ ex-husband, is a friend of Peter’s and his partner, too — they both own SportsOne. It turns out that he’s friends with more than one person in the group, though: he’s known Claudia for 15 years! The two were more than happy to catch up with each other. Kenya asks Kordell if he’s single, and he says yes. She points out that he and Claudia look “really comfortable” together.&nbsp;</p><p>“Is there maybe a date between you two in the future?” Kenya questions.</p><p>The two giggle and blush like teenagers — but they don’t deny it! Kordell mentions that he’d definitely say yes to a date if Claudia asks.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’d never been the kind of girl to actively go after someone’s ex,” Claudia admits in her confessional. “But, we’re not really friends, so I could if I wanted to.”</p><p>Kenya, Cynthia and Peter leave Claudia and Kordell alone, and they continue chatting and flirting. They exchange numbers and take an up close and personal selfie — a surefire sign of attraction. &nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I feel like Kordell might be feeling me a little bit. Why not? I’m a decent catch and know how spell!” Claudia continues in her confessional, throwing a jab at Porsha (who she works with!).&nbsp;</p><p>Claudia rejoins the girls, and Kenya raises a toast to the next Mrs. Stewart. Here comes the bride!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BWerOxwpqnZpuclsKltcBmoaiqlJa7brLLoqmtq12strW0jKmmq6uYlnq4tculoJqlo2KyuXnHrqqbmZ6ZenN8kG5pb2lf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./noel-mckoy-the-cause-of-his-death-age-wife-children-net-worth-parents-siblings-funeral-474150-html.html><span>←</span><span>Noel McKoy; the cause of his death, age, wife, children, net worth, parents, siblings, funeral</span></a>
