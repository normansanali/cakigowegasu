But according to the lawsuit, the alleged wrongdoer had already done the damage.</p><p>Wells experienced emotional anguish as a result of Lizzo’s conduct, which led to her having to quit from her work at Postmates owing to safety concerns.</p><p>The complaint seeks specific compensation for the injury done to Wells’ reputation and psychological health.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="postmates promo code,lizzo reddit,lizzo uber eats,lizzo doordash,lizzo postmates reddit,how much to tip postmates reddit" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
