And yet, they are still shooting?</li><li>When will Marvel decide to put up some walls or something around the sets of Deadpool 3? At this rate, no mystery about the film will remain under wraps.</li><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=131 data-injectable=false>While addressing the last two queries is Marvel’s problem, the collective Marvel fandom might have already decoded the first one.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>A version of Deadpool that slowly turns to Omega Red akin to Flash turning into Dark Flash in the Flash movie as he chases prime Deadpool through universes</p>— LO-DAWG (@l0_d4wg) <a href=#>January 19, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=136 data-injectable=false>Now, Omega Red is a familiar name for hardcore comic book enthusiasts, but even if you just stick to the MCU, the name will ring a bell.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-omega-red-in-marvel-comics-and-has-he-appeared-in-the-mcu data-injectable=false>Who is Omega Red in Marvel comics and has he appeared in the MCU?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Omega-Red-in-Marvel-Comics-and-Deadpool-3-1.jpg><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>So, in the comics, Omega Red is a mighty mutant serial killer who essays the role of an all-time Wolverine antagonist. Known for preying on young children and his severe bloodthirst, he ended up being a part of the Russian supersoldier program because of his “death factor” which makes it pretty difficult to kill him. As part of the program, his powers were significantly enhanced, including the addition of retractable Carbonadium tentacles in his arms.</p><p data-characters=649 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>Throughout Marvel comics, he is a regular Wolverine enemy, going up against the mutant with a focused hatred. While he is not a Deadpool variant in the comics, the specific hairstyle of the variant above does suggest that the alternate Merc With a Mouth is a hybrid version of the villain. Perhaps, on the Earth this variant resides in, Wade never managed to escape Ajax’s laboratory and instead of becoming the heroic Deadpool, he was turned into Omega Red. In case making the variant Wade Omega Red is the only switch the studio has made and the bigger points of his history and animosities remain intact, Wolverine will have a lot on his plate.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=81 data-injectable=false>Oh, and a version of Earth-616’s Omega Red almost appeared in Deadpool 2.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true>In the film, when Wade was in the high-security mutant prison, there was supposed to be a scene where Omega Red (played by NFL player Dakoda Shepley) is seen playing chess. But it never made it to the final cut and is now just another “deleted” scene. So, technically, the character doesn’t exist in the MCU as his almost debut during Fox’s reign over Deadpool never made it to the big screen.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>So, are we sure that the Deadpool variant seen is Omega Red? Maybe, maybe not, maybe it’s just a variant with a funky hairstyle. Unless Ryan Reynolds comes forward to confirm the same, like he did for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogpool</a>, checking your calendar to fruitlessly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">make July 26, 2024, come early</a> is the only option.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon66fmGK3oq%2FKppinZZeawbW1zaBksKecq7Kztc2eZKOZk6CypXnIrGSnp6dirm66xJycrKuZqcZurdJmmGamlax6o8HTZqWorF2ovG66xLBknZ2Rmb2wu8tmamabmJa%2Foq%2FTnqlmoaNisaq%2FwqitnqqVmXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-watch-bleach-in-order.html><span>←</span><span>How To Watch Bleach In Order</span></a>
