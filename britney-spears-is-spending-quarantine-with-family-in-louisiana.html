The trip down memory lane saw them looking at old photos and memorabilia as well as taking a tour of Britney’s old bedroom, where she shot her infamous 1999 Rolling Stone cover.</p><p>“I think 29 will be the year that teaches me to get back to the basics of life, and to never outgrow the simple things. I’m very fortunate, but I’ve always felt fortunate, even when I didn’t have a bedroom, because I’ve always felt loved, even when it was hard to love eachother or when it was just plain hard for mom to pay the bills. So let’s all try and love eachother through these crappy times,” the Zoey 101 alum captioned the Sunday, April 5, post. “It’s been a very eventful 29 years, and I never would have guessed what life had planned for me back when I was living on Greenlaw Church Road, but guess what…. I loved playing outside and eating ice cream then, and that’s all I wanted to do today as well. So, back to the basics for this birthday, and even when things do go back to normal, I hope I never take the simple things for granted. Thank y’all for all the birthday wishes. I appreciate and love each of you. stay safe and healthy.”</p><a href=# readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=#>I think 29 will be the year that teaches me to get back to the basics of life, and to never outgrow the simple things.

She later <a href=#>spent 30 days at a mental health facility</a> while her ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kevin Federline</strong></a> <a href=#>took care of their sons</a>, <a href=#>Preston</a>, 14, and <a href=#>Jayden</a>, 13.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “Toxic” singer’s relationship with her father, Jamie, 67, hit a bump in the road in August 2019 when he <a href=#>allegedly got into an altercation with Preston</a>. The incident prompted Federline, 42, to get a temporary restraining order against his former father-in-law, which prohibits Jamie from seeing his grandsons for three years. Authorities later <a href=#>declined to charge Jamie</a> with child abuse due to insufficient evidence.</p><p>The Spears family made headlines again in March when Jayden said on Instagram Live that his famous mom once told him she <a href=#>“might just quit” making music</a>. A source later confirmed to Us that “Britney is <a href=#>in no rush to start recording</a>” again and is “perfectly content” with her decision.</p><p>Given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19,&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;wants our readers to have access to the most accurate resources.
