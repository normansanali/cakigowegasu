"What happened on the day should not have happened and for that we are deeply sorry."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"We identified the official concerned and informed the individual in question of the complaint. The official in question accepted fully that what had happened had not been acceptable but stressed that it has not been intentional. We are committed to ensuring nothing like this will happen again," the statement continued.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The video, which has been viewed over 19 million times, has drawn widespread indignation online including seven-time Olympic medalist Simone Biles. <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Writing</a> on X, formerly known as Twitter, Biles says the incident broke her heart, saying “when this video was circulating, her parents reached out. It broke my heart to see.”</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"There is no room for racism in any sport or at all!" said Biles.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Biles said she reached out to the young gymnast last year in a private video message, expressing her support.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The now-viral incident occurred at the Gymnastics Ireland’s GymStart event in March 2022. Gymstart is <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>described</a> as a program "designed to allow any gymnast, regardless of age or ability, to take part in and enjoy gymnastics."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In a statement sent to ABC News, Ireland's Sports Ministry says the young girl was "badly let down."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Minister Catherine Martin and Minister of State Thomas Byrne have written to Gymnastics Ireland expressing their disappointment that an apology from Gymnastics Ireland was not immediately forthcoming after the incident occurred and they have asked that the sporting body confirm that measures are in place to avoid any such incidents occurring in future and to ensure that people from an ethnic minority background feel included in gymnastics," Ireland's Sports Ministry said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Speaking anonymously to the <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Irish Independent</a>, the mother of the young gymnast says the incident was upsetting for the family.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"We are often the only black family at gymnastic events and this has been very hurtful," she said. "Now eight million people have seen the video. From Pakistan to Ethiopia, they can see this was wrong."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The gymnast's mother also expressed disappointment in Gymnastics Ireland’s apology, <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>telling</a> the Irish Independent that they received a “one-line” written apology from the official addressed "to whom it may concern>"</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Gymnastics Ireland is yet to respond to ABC News’ requests for further comment.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Speaking to ABC News, Perry Ogden, CEO of Sport Against Racism Ireland (SARI) raises the question as to why the apology took so long.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"What has been most disturbing in this particular case is the time it has taken for due process to be carried out," says Ogden. "It is now 18 months since the incident. The board of Gymnastics Ireland finally made an apology to the family on Sunday. This is unacceptable."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"It is not fair on the family, nor the woman who failed to give the young girl a medal," Ogden said. "The woman was wrong, but we understand she tried to make an apology to the family and this apology was withheld by the organization."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Following the incident, the family of young girl have requested for the video to be taken down.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The young gymnast continues to participate in Gymnastics Ireland events.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCVza2cq6aRqbawusClZqCxnaOutMDInKpmoaKauaK6w2agrKulmsBuwc2rnKydoquypXnAqaalp5eueqO4wJyiZp%2Bporuiv9NmpJ6ckaF8tMDOq7B4oZRyfnF%2Fk3Jqa2tn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./godzilla-minus-one.html><span>←</span><span>Godzilla Minus One | Reelviews Movie Reviews</span></a>
