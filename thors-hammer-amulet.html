It is cast in lead, with a hole through the shaft implying that a string or tie was likely threaded through the amulet so it could be worn as a pendant.</p><p>It is also possible that it had once been gilded or silvered.</p><p>Archaeologists believe the hammer was worn around the neck as a symbol of protection. In mythology, Thor used his hammer, Mjölnir, to prevent the giants from destroying Asgard, the home of the gods.</p><p>In the Viking Age, the symbol of Mjölnir was therefore frequently associated with protective powers.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-405080 alt="Amulet Measurements" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/thor-amulet-measurments.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-405080 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Kulturmiljö Halland</span><span class=caption-body>The amulet measures 3 centimeters, or 1.18 inches.</span></p><p>According to archaeologist Per Wranning, who wrote about the discovery in the blog <a href=# rel=noopener>Kulturmiljö Halland</a>, several similar amulets have been found in Scandinavia and may have been carried away from Ysby during a period of religious transition, as much of the region began converting to Christianity.</p><p>Some historians believe these hammers were a marker of those who still worshiped the old gods as Christianity spread across the region.</p><p>Alongside the discovery of the amulet, the team also uncovered flint chips, ceramics, and a metal fitting that they believe could be from the Viking Age or early Middle Ages.</p><p>In addition, they found the remains of pits, post holes, and hearths that could further indicate the site dates back to the Viking Age.</p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener>Ancient Origins</a> reports, the finding of this Thor’s hammer comes almost a decade after the discovery of a massive Viking drinking hall in Halland in 2014.</p><p>The hall measured over 164 feet in length and 46 feet wide and featured double walls and four entrances. Measurements also indicated that a large fireplace occupied the center of the floor, revealing that the hall was of some significance to the Viking inhabitants of the region.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-405079 alt="Swedish Hearth" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/swedish-hearth.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-405079 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Cultural Environment Halland</span><span class=caption-body>The site of one of the 14 hearts found during the preliminary investigation of the Ysby site.</span></p><p>Per <a href=# rel=noopener>ZME Science</a>, the site of the dining hall was found on the Aska barrow, long believed to have been a burial mound.</p><p>But using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) techniques, researchers were able to non-invasively study subsurface structures and reveal the site’s true nature.</p><p>“Our investigation demonstrates that non-invasive geophysical measurements can be powerful tools for studying similar building foundations elsewhere,” said Andreas Viberg of the Archaeological Research Laboratory at Stockholm University, per ZME Science.</p><p>“They even allow scholars to estimate the date of a building without any expensive excavations,” Viberg added.</p><p>While the dining hall’s discovery was certainly significant, the amulet’s discovery now offers a deeper insight into the Viking culture in Halland at a significant time of change for the region.</p><p>As researchers continue their surveys in the Halland region, perhaps they will uncover even more artifacts that offer insight into the lives of the Vikings.</p><p>After reading about this enlightening discovery, read about another <a href=#>Thor’s hammer amulet that was found in Iceland</a>.
