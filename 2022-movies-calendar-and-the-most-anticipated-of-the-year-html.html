Daniel Craig’s Foghorn Leghorn impression will drawl through a second whodunit in Rian Johnson’s <a href=#>Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery</a>. There now exists such a thing as a <a href=#>Timothée Chalamet–starring teen-cannibal romance</a>. And once the holidays are over, deep in that typically dry January and February stretch, the movies will be going full-tilt unhinged. We’ll see Cocaine Bear (about a rampaging bear high on cocaine — directed by Elizabeth Banks) and M3gan, a film <a href=#>whose trailer</a> I don’t possess the words to describe. You just gotta watch it. There’s much to look forward to beyond that, too.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckxzzowdq006y3f6kibw2aqs8@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>November</span></h2><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/claismnyi003h3b6wcn2eyhy0@published>She Said</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/claisn05n003m3b6wrbvjtas4@published data-word-count=95>No, it’s not a big-screen adaptation of the 1965 party where <a href=#>the Beatles dropped acid with Peter Fonda</a>. Rather, it’s a retelling of the process by which a pair of determined New York Times reporters (played by Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan) exposed Harvey Weinstein’s decades of sex crimes. Maria Schrader’s film has earned Spotlight comparisons for its understated portrait of investigative journalism, and given that its subject is Hollywood itself, you’ll want to stay and watch the credits: Who’s played by an actor, and who’s playing themselves?

That was Elegance Bratton’s story, and now it’s the plot of his feature-film directorial debut. The Inspection is open about its debt to films like Full Metal Jacket and Beau Travail, but it features a star-making turn from Jeremy Pope plus a bitterly unglamorous performance by Gabrielle Union as the mother, which is earning the Bring It On star a bit of Supporting Actress buzz.

Anya Taylor-Joy is Margot, a woman whose annoying foodie date (Nicholas Hoult) takes her to one of the most exclusive restaurants in the world. But the famed chef (a very fun Ralph Fiennes) turns out to have planned an unusual night that involves meditations on capitalism, art, power, and a growing body count.

The Camille DeAngelis novel it’s based on is about teenage cannibals, so expect some gruesomeness alongside the longing as Chalamet and Taylor Russell play a drifter and an outcast traveling across the country looking for self-acceptance while grappling with some gory impulses.

Hangman takes to the skies again?? Sign us up! Of course, this is based on a very moving true-life story, so it will likely be quite different from a Top Gun–style action fantasy. It’s directed by J.D. Dillard, whose previous feature, the intensely suspenseful, expertly mounted castaway thriller Sweetheart, is a genre delight.

As yet, writer-director Rian Johnson has revealed almost nothing of the plot. But with Greece serving as the backdrop to evil under the sun this time and a sprawling ensemble cast that includes Kate Hudson, Leslie Odom Jr., Edward Norton, Dave Bautista, and Janelle Monae, expect more Agatha Christie–like intrigue.

H. Lawrence’s famously horny novel of the same name, which was banned for obscenity in several countries, <a href=#>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</a> looks like exactly the wrong thing to watch with your family over the holidays. Emma Corrin is Lady Constance Chatterley, a young and depressed aristocrat stuck in a loveless marriage to Sir Clifford Chatterley (Matthew Duckett). When Constance falls for Oliver Mellors (Jack O’Connell), the sexy (and married) gamekeeper, the two embark on a dramatic and rather unabashed sexual affair. The lush film is directed by The Mustang’s Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre and adapted with Life of Pi writer David Magee.

Instead, the movie might well benefit from the controversy — both increasing the curiosity factor and helping give the star another comeback narrative (in a year that already saw him win an Academy Award). And the picture looks like it could be special: Based on a true story, it’s an Antoine Fuqua–directed period action film about a man who flees slavery in Louisiana and travels north to join the Union Army. The director has a facility with visceral violence (The Equalizer movies), but he has shown an ability to handle big, emotional stories when given the right material (Training Day).

(Well, not exactly “brand” new: The film is based on the acclaimed 2014 John Banville novel The Black-Eyed Blonde.) After years of dadsploitation action flicks, Neeson clearly wants a change of pace. This could well combine his tough-guy appeal with the more delicate portrayals of his early career. And Jordan, a master of mood and myth, could be the perfect director for him.

Set in a conservative Mennonite community, Women Talking is about just that. Its characters, played by an impressive ensemble of actors that includes Rooney Mara, Jessie Buckley, and Claire Foy, have been tasked with figuring out what’s next for the women of the colony, who’ve been subjected to a campaign of druggings and rapes by a group of the men. Over conversations that range from rage to the nature of forgiveness, they try to figure out a way forward. The setting may feel exotic, but the questions asked are universal.

(If nothing else, it’s got to be better than Robert Zemeckis’s <a href=#>disastrous CGI adaptation</a> from earlier this year, which pretty much everybody hated.) Here’s a director whose unfettered imagination could actually bring something new to this oft-told tale — a sense of possibility and wonder that too many versions have lacked in the past. This time, the story is set in fascist Italy, which could add a relevant political edge to the material — not unlike del Toro’s 2006 Oscar-winner Pan’s Labyrinth.

Oh, and he’s aided by Harry Melling playing a young cadet named Edgar Allan Poe! Cooper’s work can be hit or miss — Hostiles and Crazy Heart were terrific, while Black Mass and Out of the Furnace were not — but the director certainly understands atmosphere, and this film feels like it will play to his strengths. And never discount Bale’s charisma. Amsterdam might have been a bust, but he was one of the best things about it.

Night Shyamalan’s comeback campaign a resounding success yet? The box-office receipts for The Visit, Split, Glass, and Old have demonstrated his reliable ability to make hits on relatively low budgets, but Knock at the Cabin could be the real test. Based on Paul Tremblay’s novel The Cabin at the End of the World, it feels like a bridge between the films that Shyamalan used to make and the ones he’s been making in more recent years. Set in a remote cabin where a couple (Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge) are vacationing with their daughter, it’s a hostage thriller about the arrival of cultists (lead by Dave Bautista) who are convinced that the apocalypse is nigh and only they know how to stop it.
