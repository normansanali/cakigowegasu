Of course, with dangerous stunts come plenty of injuries, and with those injuries comes the need to find a way to control chronic pain. For Raab, the solution was prescription painkillers and alcohol, and lots of both.</p><p>In a 2018 <a href=#>Page Six</a> piece on the "Jackass" crew, Raab revealed that jostling for screen time with other cast members resulted in a willingness to take on more danger, and the resulting mishaps left him with an addiction to painkillers and alcohol.
