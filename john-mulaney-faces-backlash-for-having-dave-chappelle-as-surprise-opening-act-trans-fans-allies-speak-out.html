The comedian was the headliner at a show in Columbus, Ohio on Friday (May 20) and Dave popped on stage to be the surprise opener.
Fans were required to lock their phones up before the show, so there is no footage of the set, but attendees say that Dave made transphobic jokes. After his opening set, John came on stage and gave Dave a hug."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Also very disheartening to hear a crowd of 12,000 around you (a trans person) laughing at transphobic jokes.
