Last Fall, my husband and I flew to Boston, Massachusetts to meet up with his Mom, sister, and her husband to spend a few days driving up the coast of New England. This Arizona girl was eating it all up! I loved everything from the vibrant orange and gold leaves, the cozy shops, the apple picking, the fresh apple cider, the beautiful crisp New England weather, and being able to wear a cozy sweater.</p><p>We drove to Vermont and stayed in the dreamiest and coziest home and fell in love with the quintessential charm of Stowe Vermont. Then we spent an entire day apple picking and then coming home and making a beautiful charcuterie board with Vermont Cabot cheese, freshly picked Honeycrisp apples, and drinking apple cider. It was my kind of heaven!</p><p>We flew home with much heavier luggage because I brought pounds and pounds of fresh apples home. I couldn’t wait to make a homemade apple crisp with the apples we picked. It was the best apple crisp I have ever eaten in my life!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Apple-Crisp-1-1-scaled.jpg alt="Apple Crisp.

Being able to wear a sweatshirt is always a huge milestone in Arizona when the temperatures dip just crisp and cool enough to actually put on a light jacket. This means it is officially Fall in Arizona and we are eating it up.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Apple-Crisp-5-1-scaled.jpg alt="Apple Crisp.

Apple Crisp is one of my husband’s favorite desserts of all time, so it was about time I shared my recipe.</p><p>This is hands down the best apple crisp recipe! It is such a foolproof classic dessert made with fresh apples and a homemade brown sugar pecan crumble.

The buttery brown sugar pecan crumble is made with butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, sugar, flour, and pecans (or your favorite kind of nut). It is baked until the apples are bubbling and the topping is crisp.</p><p>I have such distinct memories of Sunday dinners growing up around the dining room table. We almost always had roast and mashed potatoes and apple crisp for dessert. I can still remember the smell of the apples and cinnamon baking in the oven. This is the quintessential&nbsp; All-American dessert and reminds me of home.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Apple-Crisp-4-scaled.jpg alt="Apple Crisp.

Keep people guessing by using two different kinds of apples. Peel, core, and slice into 1-inch bite-size pieces. Sprinkle with sugar and lemon juice. The lemon juice keeps the apples from turning brown and also adds some acidity to help balance out the sweetness.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Make a HOMEMADE BROWN SUGAR PECAN TOPPING</strong>.&nbsp; This is made with simple ingredients — cold butter, brown sugar, sugar, cinnamon, flour, and pecans. Cold butter is important as it helps to keep the topping together once it hits the hot oven.&nbsp; Make the topping first and then place it in the refrigerator while you prepare the apples to keep the topping chilled.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Bake until BUBBLY and GOLDEN</strong>. Place the apples in 8 x 8, 9 x 9 baking pans, or small individual ramekins.&nbsp; Generously sprinkle with topping, lightly pressing into the apples. If you want to make a larger portion, double the recipe and it will fill a 9 x 13 baking pan. Let cool for at least 5-10 minutes to allow the filling to set up and then top with vanilla bean ice cream.</li></ul><p>You are going to love this homemade apple crumble crisp recipe! It will remind you of cozy nights spent with family with the crisp apples and sweet brown sugar crumble topping.</p><h2>POPULAR APPLE RECIPES:</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>CARAMEL APPLE CINNAMON ROLLS</strong></a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>DUTCH APPLE PIE</strong></a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>FRENCH APPLE CAKE</strong></a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>APPLES FRITTERS and DIY APPLE CIDER BAR</strong></a></p><p>I love to hear from you!
