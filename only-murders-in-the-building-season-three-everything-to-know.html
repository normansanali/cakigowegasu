The synopsis reads: "When a grisly death occurs inside their exclusive Upper West Side apartment building, the trio suspects murder and employs their precise knowledge of true crime to investigate the truth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2a9362e99b76-only-murders-ep-2-z.jpg><p id=ejsss28xSYy data-wc=18><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Only Murders in the Building season 2 ending explained - and what it means for season 3</a></p><p id=e4INoEU_1pX data-wc=62>"As they record a podcast of their own to document the case, the three unravel the complex secrets of the building which stretch back years. Perhaps even more explosive are the lies they tell one another.

On opening night of Oliver’s new show, Ben Glenroy (Rudd) only manages to get out a few words before collapsing and dying, setting the stage for season three. It looks like someone murdered Ben - and that Charles is set to be the prime suspect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/02e724c5fc7f-only-murders-t.jpg><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
