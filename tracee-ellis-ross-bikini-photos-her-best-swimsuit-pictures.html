The Emmy nominee takes style inspiration from her mother, </span><a href=#><b>Diana Ross</b></a><span>, who is a fashion icon in her own right. Tracee shows off her <a href=#>bikini body in photos</a> posted on her social media accounts often.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“[Sharing my outfits] is a way to put joy in action for me. When I get dressed, I think to myself, ‘Ah, I like </span><i><span>her,</span></i><span> I </span><i><span>remember</span></i><span> her!’ She got lost a little bit,” she told </span><a href=#><i><span>Harper’s Bazaar</span></i></a><span> in June 2021 about her wardrobe. “During the pandemic, I continued working and there was no question that I continued putting on my lipstick, putting on a beautiful top and earrings and necklaces and things like that, but to be going back out into the world and getting dressed for that — I missed that part of my life.”</span></p><p><span>Tracee’s poolside looks are full of vibrant colors, different cuts and styles and unique patterns. In a May 2022 Instagram video, the television producer shared that the pool is her “happy place.” She rocked a black bikini with cutouts on the sides before taking a dive into the water. The star has bared her stunning figure in both <a href=#>bikini pictures</a> and workout videos since joining Instagram.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I’m a big advocate for keeping my body moving,” she told</span> <a href=#><span>PopSugar</span></a> <span>about her workout routine in June 2017. “It is definitely vain, and it is about aesthetics, but truthfully I feel better about myself when I work out. I sleep better, my back feels better, my knees feel better … when I’m moving and keeping my body long and strong, I feel like I’m more productive and I get more done in a day.”</span></p><p><span>With so many captivating looks, it’s no wonder that Tracee has become an expert at capturing most of her gorgeous photos on her own.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I don’t travel with an entourage,” she said during an interview with </span><a href=#><span>Who What Wear</span></a><span>. “It’s [just] me. And sometimes I’m like, ‘I really look good right now! I should really document it!’”</span></p><p><span>The </span><i><span>Girlfriends</span></i><span> actress went on to say that she first began taking photos of her outfits with her camera’s auto-timer <a href=#>when she was a teenager</a>. She later graduated to using her phone self-timer. Tracee’s style has definitely evolved over the years, and she posts throwback photos regularly to take a look back.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I used to sit in my mom’s dressing room and watch her get dressed,” she recalled. “There are early pictures of me dressed up in her things. I think I was always drawn to the bold and the glamorous and the beautiful.”</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see Tracee’s stunning bikini photos.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tqZqblZp6prjLoqpmqp%2BowG6uyKSgp6FdpbWwwM6sZKGdomKvpr%2FTZqqwoZ2owqrAjKmgnKylp7K0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shelly-martinez-reacts-to-alberto-del-rios-arrest-says-he-dated-one-of-her-homegirls.html><span>←</span><span>Shelly Martinez Reacts To Alberto Del Rios Arrest Says He Dated One Of Her Homegirls</span></a>
