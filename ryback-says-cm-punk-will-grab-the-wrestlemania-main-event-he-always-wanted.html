And like I said, I think it is a weird chess game going on where he is going to go there and shoot on stuff in a more negative way and call bullsh*t when he sees it on things that he doesn’t like, and he is allowed to give his opinion on different things. And FOX is going to allow it, where it is going to create a situation where he is going to probably be able to go back and get the WrestleMania main event match that he always wanted. That is what I feel like is going on, and that is why I feel like he didn’t go to AEW,”</p><p>CM Punk is not going to AEW, that is pretty certain at this point. You never know what can happen in pro wrestling, but right now the Second City Savior seems to be having a really good time sitting at home with AJ Lee and his dog Larry while we all think about what he’ll do next.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=#>Wrestling Inc</a> for the quote</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
