Following the shocking season 17 premiere of <a href=#>Grey’s Anatomy</a>, star and producer <a href=#><strong>Ellen Pompeo</strong></a> appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! to break down <a href=#><strong>Patrick Dempsey</strong></a>‘s return. Although she played coy about what’s next, the host, 53, still asked some very funny questions.</p><p>“This is a hypothetical [question], of course. Let’s say that since he left the show, Patrick had put on, like, 80 pounds. He was really fat,” host <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a>&nbsp;asked Pompeo, 51, during the Thursday, November 12, episode. “Do you think you would still have done this? Would it be like, he’s like, ‘Hey, here I am on the beach! I’ve been eating.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Greys-Anatomys-Ellen-Pompeo-Reveals-How-Shocking-Premiere-Reunion-Came-About-Patrick-Dempsey-Beach.jpg><p>After some laughter, the actress responded, “Nope, probably not! It wouldn’t have the same impact with the fans. You know, the girls want to see McDreamy being McDreamy.”</p><p>At the end of Thursday’s episode, <a href=#>Dempsey, 54, returned to the show</a> for the first time in five years. The <a href=#>character of Derek Shepherd died in a car crash</a> at the end of season 11, leaving Meredith absolutely shattered.</p><p>During the premiere, Meredith was found unconscious in the Grey Sloan parking lot. When she wouldn’t wake up, the cameras cut to a gorgeous beach, where she reunited <a href=#>with her late husband</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fans will see more of Derek in upcoming episodes, showrunner <strong>Krista Vernoff</strong> revealed to <a href=#>Deadline</a> after the episode. Vernoff, as well as Dempsey and Pompeo, also explained that they wanted to bring back the character now — in 2020 — to give fans a reason to smile after such a difficult year.</p><p>“I really love the message of what the dynamic is in this story. With everything that we’re dealing with right now — and certainly, we have been distracted with the election — but we’re going to get back into the reality of COVID and being in a pandemic, and all the lives that have been lost,” the Devils actor said. “Where are these souls going? And I think that’s what attracted me to this story line, I think it can be really helpful and healing to so many people.”</p><p>Grey’s Anatomy airs on ABC Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJylpJWjerG7zKmcqGWfo3qxrdOroJyjXZmyrrzSnrCsZaKawba%2BzWarqGWXp7K6v4yapZqsn6LGbsLInZyoZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ella-leonard-obituary-winterset-iowa-ella-leonard-death-and-funeral.html><span>←</span><span>Ella Leonard Obituary Winterset Iowa, Ella Leonard Death And Funeral funeral obits memorial</span></a>
