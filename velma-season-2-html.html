After audiences were unhappy with many of their favorite shows and movies receiving the ax and heading into the vault, some are stunned that the adult animated series, Velma, will be back for Season 2.</p><p>Mindy Kaling created the animated project in which she also lends her vocals as the titular member of the Scooby gang. Although it faced some pushback, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> reveals that the show’s staying power was enough to earn Velma a Season 2 renewal.</p><p>The news was shared alongside other big announcements at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival which also unveiled a new <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Disney data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Disney</a> short as well as a short from the increasingly popular Spider-Verse franchise.</p><p>From its very first teaser, Velma was a hit-or-miss topic with fans of the Scooby-Doo franchise which is what makes its Season 2 renewal all the more shocking. After being slammed for its “woke” takeover and its change of several of the characters, it would appear as though inclusivity is winning out once again as Warner Bros. and Max will carry the mysteries into a second season.</p><p>Along with Kaling, the series also stars the vocal talents of Glenn Howerton (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia), Constance Wu (Crazy Rich Asians), Sam Richardson (Veep), Jane Lynch (Glee), Ming-Na Wen (The Book of Boba Fett), Wanda Sykes (The Other Two), and more.</p><p>The series acts as an origin story of the crew who comes to be known as Mysteries Inc. who were, of course, made popular in the Scooby-Doo franchise. Although no plot details for Velma Season 2 have been released at this time, we can expect more hijinks and jinkies where the previous season left off.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/velma-animated-phone-ghosts-900x506.jpg><p>Quickly gaining a name for itself as a new home of adult animation entertainment, the network also revealed that along with Velma Season 2, a handful of other shows would be either premiering or returning for another installment. Included in the lineup was Harley Quinn, <a href=#>Clone High</a>, Ten Year Old Tom, Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake, Young Love, Fired on Mars, Scavengers Reign, Creature Commandos, and Kite Man: Hell Yeah!</p><p>Although they faced a lot of backlash for the different spin Kaling and the rest of the creative team put on Velma, Suzanna Makkos, the executive vice president of original comedy and adult animation for Max and Adult Swim, shed some light on the reason why the series would be back for Season 2. During her statement at Annecy, she shared that Max’s goal has always been to bring audiences terrific comedic productions that are also “diverse and inclusive” that have “thematic resonance.”</p><p>So, while some may be upset that Velma Season 2 is on the way, it seems that the production won’t be going anywhere soon – at least if HBO has something to say about it. Despite the naysayers, Kaling’s new take on the classic mystery solvers has drawn the attention of enough fans to help it return for more spooky adventures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iulaG6onnSnpisp55if2%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyler-stanaland.html><span>←</span><span>Tyler Stanaland</span></a>
