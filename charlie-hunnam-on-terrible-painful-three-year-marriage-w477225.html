We had fallen madly in love and it was the first time I had ever been in love.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/665061352_charlie-hunnam-zoom-6bd66f0a-ec47-41ec-aab3-040493577bad.jpg><p>The pair decided to elope before Hunnam, then 18, had to head back home to England. “We thought, ‘What if we never see each other again? Let’s get married and then we’ll have to see each other again even if it’s just to get divorced,’” he recalled. “So we came to Vegas, but I couldn’t even get a drink so I actually didn’t think I would be able to get married.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/595055034_katharine-towne-zoom-555e2d05-4dfc-412b-9edd-ac3a75b06d81.jpg><p>But anything goes in Sin City. At 2 A.M., Hunnam and Towne said “I do” in front of Silver Bell Wedding Chapel’s Reverend RJ Cotton. (They wanted to get married by Elvis but “he left the building,” joked Hunnam.)</p><span class=caption></span><p>The end result: “Three terrible years,” admitted Hunnam, whose divorce was finalized in 2002. “Three terrible, painful, expensive years. I got the cats at the end of it, so that was good. There was a small victory.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/146537637_charlie-hunnam-morgana-mcnelis-zoom-82129850-2d4d-4bab-833c-385c1e5c66db.jpg><p>He’s since gone on to find success in his 12-year relationship with jewelry designer <b>Morgana McNelis</b>. The pair reside in a $2.76 million Hollywood Hills pad that likely sees a lot of action.

I also try to make love as often as I can. That’s an important part of fitness. There’s no reason you can’t be active at 70. I want to run up mountains at that age,” Hunnam told <i>Men’s Health</i>. “We are supposed to be very active animals. It’s our DNA. Sweating is how I change my oil every day. I just feel happier, more positive, energized, and disciplined if I work out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJGnuaqxjKGsp6aRonqwuoytnKuqmZe5pnnPmqCnnqWherW00Z6cZrGVlr9uucCrqaKZl5p6uICWcGlrbV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./avery-stamm.html><span>←</span><span>Avery Stamm</span></a>
