Another palace source confirms that due to Philip's passing, a new birthday portrait of the monarch will not be released to the public, as her official mourning period continues until this Friday. The queen, along with other members of the royal family—including Prince Charles and his sons, Princes William and Harry—<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/g36146426/prince-philip-funeral-photos/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="came together on Saturday" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">came together on Saturday</a> to honor the life of the Duke of Edinburgh with an official funeral ceremony.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Further, a spokesperson for Britain's Ministry of Defense confirms that the traditional gun salutes, which take place at Hyde Park and the Tower of London to mark the queen's birthday, will not happen for the second year in a row. (The tradition took an initial pause last year due to the start of national COVID-19 lockdowns across the United Kingdom.) The queen's annual summertime birthday celebration, known as Trooping the Colour, will also not take place this year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though the queen will not be taking part in any public royal engagements in the coming weeks, she will still be working from home. The monarch will personally respond to messages from world leaders who expressed their condolences over the duke's passing. Prince William, Duchess Kate, and Prince Charles are also expected to respond to global figures who reached out after Philip's passing with correspondence being sent out via Kensington Palace and Clarence House.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
