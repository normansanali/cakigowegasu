The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>19-year-old posed nude</a> for&nbsp;Sports Illustrated‘s new section, “In Her Own Words,” which aims to empower women through voice, identity, and self-expression.

Check the stunning shot out below!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>But the words are just as important as the visual image, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Christie Brinkley</strong></a>‘s daughter shared some great ones when she posted the photo on Instagram. “I am a fighter. I am strong. I am romantic. I am creative. I am optimistic. I am natural. I am a work in progress, constantly evolving and learning,” she captioned the empowering image, before going on to show her appreciation for those who helped with the project. The photoshoot — which was entirely female-run, from the crew to the editors — made all of the participating models their own art directors, meaning that they all chose the words painted onto their bodies.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>This isn’t Sailor’s first collaboration with the magazine.&nbsp;Sports Illustrated named the budding model one of its 2018 Rookies for its Swimsuit Edition. In 2017, she also posed for the magazine in a bathing suit with her mom and half-sister&nbsp;<strong>Alexa Ray Joel</strong>.
