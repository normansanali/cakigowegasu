Must admit I shed a few tears</strong>. Won't put out any spoilers but I will miss this show." A second agreed, writing: "I'm gonna smile because it happened and cry when it's all over thank you for 14 incredible years #NCISLA."</p><p id=eMC0XOG2Dht data-wc=17>A third simply said: "More tears, so sad it's over. Forever. &nbsp;What a good run it was."</p><p id=eLKh7iFEmU data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>NCIS: LA star Medalion Rahimi talks proudest moment as long-running show comes to an end</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eVh5TI7ERT data-wc=9><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Zac Efron looks completely different in NCIS cameo</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7a49271fc95d-ncis-sam-and-callen.jpg><p id=enmulab139t data-wc=43>However, there was some light in the episode because some audience members were convinced that another spin-off could be on the way when the show hinted at Sam Hanna (LL Cool J) and G. Callen (Chris O'Donnell)'s future with a project in Morocco.</p><p id=ehSWzBrKPps data-wc=52>Upon arriving in Morocco, Sam and Callen come across Nell (Renee Felice Smith) and other members of their team and are tasked with helping Hetty (Linda Hunt) who has "got herself into a bit of a pickle." Nell then turns to her team and says: "Are you ready for your next adventure?"</p><p id=eDaMwZaoun_ data-wc=42>Viewers at home picked up on this detail and are hoping an NCIS: Morocco could be on the way. "Whoa, I didn’t realize #NCISLA was ending! Last scene… will that team in Morocco have a spin-off? NCIS International?" one wrote on Twitter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/537c86f0541c-gettyimages-1244298534.jpg><p id=eLg8QOiTzSA data-wc=51>Another had the same idea, commenting: "What??? NELL IN MOROCCO? I was NOT expecting this #ncisla," as a third said: "Wait, are we getting NCIS Morocco or..." A fourth added: "Why do I have a feeling we might get a new series with Callen and Sam following this new adventure???? #NCISLA."</p><p id=ehuCYWUdcNx data-wc=57>The bosses on the show have not confirmed whether another spin-off is in the works, but showrunner, R. Scott Gemmill told the Wrap why the storyline was left open-ended. "It just seemed like that was a storyline that we needed to resolve," they said, adding: "And what better way than to go and send a rescue team?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6caa69ef196a-eric-christian-olsen-ll-cool-j-ncis-la.jpg><p id=erirtB62mw8 data-wc=50>Elsewhere in the finale, fan-favorite couple Kensi Blye (Daniela Ruah) and Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen) found out they were having a baby. After receiving a call from her doctor, Kensi looked shocked before hanging up the phone and turning to her partner tearfully and said: "We're having a baby."</p><p id=ebJH2SsYJs- data-wc=42>The couple had faced fertility struggles in the show in the past so the news was a heartwarming surprise from them both. The pair turned to their adopted daughter, Rosa (Natalia Del Riego) and said: "You're going to be a big sister."</p><p id=eFxoqwSkcbA data-wc=40>Fans were overwhelmed with emotion watching the moment unfold. One summed it up, writing: "Y'all Kensi and Deeks reaction to finally being pregnant made me tear up... because they literally gave up on it because they tried so much. #Ncisla."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd6e94419b73-gettyimages-1245392394.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/87314c76696e-cote-de-pablo-on-ncis.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5c6478f0a46a-ll-cool-j-ncis-la-eric-christian-olsen.jpg><p id=eku0sBJ_hk data-wc=26></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
