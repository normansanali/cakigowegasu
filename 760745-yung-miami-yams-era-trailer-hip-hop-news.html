She first <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">hinted at this</a> back in January in a vague tweet. She wrote, "Welcome to the "Yams Era" I'm so excited for this era of my life we about to have some FUN!!!" To this day, fans still are not sure what this all means. If you search the web for what Yams is there are a couple of explanations. One of which is a way to pronounce Miami (My-Yam-Me). Not surprisingly, the Urban Dictionary also has some unique definitions of it.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-yung-miami-is-hungrier-than-ever-before>Yung Miami Is Hungrier Than Ever Before</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Overall though, it seems Yung Miami is really embracing where she is from and is going to bring that into whatever she does. A month later after hinting at this new approach, she posted a "Yams" trailer on her Instagram. In the video, she is talking to whoever is recording her about making a comeback with shots of her in the studio making new music. A sneak peek of a ginger hairstyle also seems to be her next look as she states it in the visuals as well. Miami captioned the post, saying, "Welcome to the YAMs Era! The Yams Era is my Prime time! In the Yams we do ginger hair‚Ä¶focus on ourselves‚Ä¶& get money! Yams is the new lingo‚Ä¶ To my fans, The YAMS‚Ä¶this is the new us. Drop a üç† if you‚Äôre ready!" JT, Saweetie, and others flooded her comments with the yam emoji and support for this new outlook.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on Yung Miami's trailer for her "Yams Era?"
