Jordan Really Thinks Of Jonathan Majors After Making Creed 3 Together</a></span></p><p>The allegations against Majors were serious and led to widespread condemnation from both fans and colleagues. It wasn't long before rumors began to circulate that Jordan had ended his friendship with the embattled actor. While neither party has confirmed or denied these rumors, it's clear that their relationship has been strained in recent months. Here's everything to know about the ongoing situation thus far.</p><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-michael-b-jordan-and-jonathan-majors-friendship>Everything To Know About Michael B. Jordan And Jonathan Majors Friendship</h2><p>Jordan and Majors are two of the most talented actors in Hollywood today. Both have made a name for themselves in recent years, with Jordan starring in blockbuster hits like Creed and Black Panther.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Michael B. Jordan Went To Therapy Following His Villainous Role In Black Panther</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Majors has wowed audiences with his performances in The Last Black Man in San Francisco and Lovecraft Country. However, what many people may not know is that these two actors are actually best friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/michael-b-jordan-and-jonathan-majors-embracing-1.jpg><p>Both had grown up in modest circumstances – Jordan in Newark, New Jersey, and Majors in Dallas, Texas – and both were determined to make it big in Hollywood despite facing numerous obstacles along the way. When they finally got to know each other while filming for Creed 3, they bonded over their shared struggles as well as their passion for acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These two actors starred together in the movie as Adonis Creed and Kenny Porter, respectively. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The New York Times</a>, their friendship began when they first met during rehearsals for Creed 3. They quickly hit it off and spent time together both on and off-set. The chemistry between them was palpable on screen as they played their roles with ease.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Michael B. Jordan Appeared In The Fake Drake And 21 Savage Music Video</a></span></p><p>One thing that sets their friendship apart is their ability to push each other toward excellence. As actors, they constantly challenge each other to be better by sharing feedback on performances and offering constructive criticism. They are not afraid to call out each other's mistakes but do so in a way that is supportive rather than critical.</p><p>Since working with Jordan on Creed 3, <a href=#>Majors has shown up in the MCU as the villainous Kang the Conqueror</a>. He's also had some serious allegations that have shattered the public's perception of him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-was-jonathan-majors-accused-of-in-2023>What Was Jonathan Majors Accused Of In 2023?</h2><p>The entertainment industry has been rocked by the allegations against Majors. These allegations came to light in 2023, causing a massive uproar among fans and fellow actors alike. According to reports, several women have accused Majors of personal harassment and inappropriate behavior on set. While the exact details of these allegations are not yet known, they have already caused significant damage to Majors' reputation and career.</p><p>On March 25th, 2023, Majors was arrested in New York after his girlfriend called the police on him. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Vox, his unnamed lover was bruised and has since filed a restraining order on Majors</a>.</p><p>Further accusations against Majors have been made that are serious and alarming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jonathan-majors-in-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-via-youtube-marvel-entertainment-channel.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Variety, several women have come forward</a> with stories of how they experienced inappropriate behavior from the actor during auditions or on set. Some alleged that he physically hurt them while others accused him of making unwanted romantic advances towards them. These allegations bring into focus the issue of accountability for questionable behavior in the entertainment industry.</p><p>It really is mind-blowing how Majors went from being so beloved for his incredible acting and <a href=#>dedication to health and fitness</a>, all the way to being someone so problematic and disliked. How has Jordan reacted to this swing in perception?</p><h2 id=what-does-michael-b-jordan-think-about-jonathan-major-39-s-accusations>What Does Michael B. Jordan Think About Jonathan Major's Accusations?</h2><p>It is worth noting that Jordan himself has been a strong advocate for the #MeToo movement and has spoken out against that type of behavior in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Vanity Fair last year, he expressed his support for victims of abuse and emphasized the importance of creating a safe environment on set. Given this stance, it seems unlikely that he would turn a blind eye to any credible accusations against someone he knows personally.</p><p>At the same time, however, it is important not to jump to conclusions or make assumptions about their friendship based on rumors or speculation. It is possible that Jordan may choose to distance himself from Majors if these allegations are proven true or if there is evidence that suggests he was aware of them but failed to act appropriately.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/michael-b-jordan-and-jonathan-majors-in-creed-iii.jpg><p>​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless of what happens next between them personally, it is clear that both Jordan and Majors will continue to be successful actors in their own right. They each possess unique talents and abilities that have earned them critical acclaim and widespread recognition within Hollywood circles.</p><p>As such, it is likely that they will continue to cross paths professionally in the future, whether as co-stars or competitors. Only time will tell what the future holds for their friendship, but one thing is certain: their impact on the entertainment industry will be felt for years to come. In a way, it already has. Creed 3 was a critically acclaimed film.</p><p>Jordan's response to the situation has been measured, indicating that he is taking time to process the information before making any decisions about their friendship. According to The Root, Jordan hasn't publicly reacted yet to the Majors' situation. However, he has also made it definitely clear that he does not condone any behavior that goes against his values or beliefs, and is ultimately taking his time to develop his thoughts and feelings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the rest of Hollywood turning their back on Majors, it's only a matter of time before Jordan breaks his silence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoraktMCeo2aaXZ%2B8s7DAp2SdoaOprq%2BvxGafoqWjmrmnecWrpqZllqe2prrDZqGoppGptaK6jKaYo6eiqHqiuMuenp6cXZavtr%2FEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meghan-markle-wedding-dress-designer-david-emanuel-brand.html><span>←</span><span>David Emanuel Princess Diana's Wedding Dress Designer Might Design Meghan Markle's Gown</span></a>
