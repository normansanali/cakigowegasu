So proud of my man!” she wrote on the photo. The reality personality wore a red dress that hit just above her knees, and Dillard matched his tie to the color of her dress.</p><p>The future lawyer explained on Friday, May 7, that he’d graduated with an accounting degree exactly 10 years earlier with the support of his mother. He couldn’t have finished his latest degree without the mother of his own children.</p><p>“My mom was my biggest supporter during that time, and my wife has helped me make it through law school,” the father of two wrote <a href=#>in a lengthy caption</a>. “I couldn’t have done it without either of them, and they both continue to be my biggest supporters. Happy Mother’s Day to Jill and my mom!”</p><p>Duggar and Dillard share sons Israel, 6, and Samuel, 3.</p><p>The happy moment followed a tumultuous few weeks for the extended Duggar family. <a href=#><strong>Josh Duggar</strong></a>, Jill’s brother, was arrested on child pornography charges on April 29.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/That-Red-Dress-Jill-Duggar-Celebrates-Husband-Derick-Dillards-Law-School-Graduation-Feature.jpg><p>“We just found out this information yesterday,” <a href=#>Jill and Dillard told Us Weekly</a> on April 30. “It is very sad.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Josh, 33, was <a href=#>released on bail after his lawyer pleaded not guilty</a> on his behalf, but he is not allowed to return to his home with his children. He is staying with pastor Lacount Reber and his wife, Maria Reber, during his home confinement, and Josh is only allowed to see his six kids when wife <a href=#><strong>Anna Duggar</strong></a> is present.</p><p>Jill revealed earlier this month that her community has been supporting her more than ever during Josh’s latest scandal.</p><p>“We were reminded this morning in church about how important community is! I think I’ve brought this up before, but I’ve literally prayed for good community!! We need others for support, prayer … people to do life with and so much more,” Jill wrote via Instagram on May 2. “I know this last year has tested all of us so much, but sometimes it’s in the difficult times that you see more clearly who your people are as they become the hands and feet of Jesus!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajoZyheqXBxqCYq2WTmrmmrtGaq56rXZmys7XCpGSdoZyhrrOw0majmq9dqLCpu86lZKCqkZnCosDIqKVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apple-q2-fy-2019-earnings-report.html><span>←</span><span>iPhone Struggles But iPad And Services Expand</span></a>
