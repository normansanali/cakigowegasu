Also, it’s been quite a while since we last heard them talk about each other.</span></p><p><span>Here’s Dominic’s IG @</span><a href=#><span>dominicfike</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Recalling their moments, Dominic and Diana did look like they were meant for each other. And it sure would cause many heartbreaks if the two have broken up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The </span><i><span>Euphoria</span></i><span> star often talked about how Diana influenced his music. “She likes old music, movies, and clothing. It’s influenced my music for the better,” he once shared.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, he also once revealed that they were so close they shared a closet. In fact, over that interview, he even was wearing one of Diana’s zebra socks.</span></p><p><span>The last we saw them together was in mid-2021, quarantined at their apartment.

He has dated over 2 ladies in the past.</span></p><p><span>The rumors about him being “gay’, was just a downside that came along with popularity. As of 2022, there were no reports about the star ever having a relationship with a man.</span></p><p><span>If you’re here after seeing Dominic sharing a steamy kiss with Lil Nas X, it was just for their song “Count On Me” music video.</span></p><p><span>And for those of you who missed it, the music video begins with the pair as lovers on holiday, which quickly turns into an animation, after they kiss passionately.</span></p><h3><b>Dominic Fike Dating History</b></h3><p><span>Before dating Diana Silvers, Dominic Fike was in a relationship with a </span><i><span>Columbia Records</span></i><span> stylist, named Shelby Tangorra.
