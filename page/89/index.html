Michiel Huisman and Doona Bae in Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire. Crumbling under the weight of its own visionary grandiosity, Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon is a series of amazing-looking sets and costumes and effects looking for a story, characters, emotion — really, anything that might raise the pulse. Maybe part of that is due to the fact that this, like so many other movies nowadays, is a Part One — subtitled A Child of Fire, which could mean that the real fireworks will come in the next installment.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>6 Healthy Superfood Smoothies Modern Honey</h2><time>Aug 17, 2024</time>
