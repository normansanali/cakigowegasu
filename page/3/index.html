You’ve heard of Garfield minus Garfield, but what would Three’s Company have been like without Chrissy and Janet? Or with M*A*S*H legend Larry Gelbart at the helm? It might have happened! Over the weekend, YouTube user Mantronix4ever posted two unaired pilots for ABC’s jiggle-licious mid-seventies comedy smash. The first, and most fascinating, features the late John Ritter as David (not Jack), the same sniping Ropers (Norman Fell and Audra Lindley), but with two different actresses playing the female roommates: Valerie Curtin (Jane’s cousin) in what would become Joyce DeWitt’s role, and Susanne Zenor keeping Suzanne Somers’s future seat warm.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is On the 50 Dollar Bill?

In the world of anime, where hairstyles and facial expressions are crucial to the overall visual aesthetic, fans can be extremely critical of any visual change in direction when it affects popular characters.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>You Can Now Play Resident Evil Village In Third Person</h2><time>Oct 1, 2024</time>
