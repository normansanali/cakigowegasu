While his answer is no, his extensive experience in the NFL has given him a deep understanding of the sport and its players. Goodell was born into a prominent New York family and graduated from Washington and Jefferson College before beginning his career in the NFL as an administrative intern. He worked his way up the ranks to become the executive vice president and chief operating officer before being elected as commissioner in 2006.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of Goodell's major accomplishments as commissioner was implementing a personal conduct policy in 2007, which allowed him to punish players for their illegal or unethical behavior. This policy was put in place after several high-profile cases of player misconduct, including domestic violence and dogfighting, had tarnished the league's image. Goodell's handling of these cases, however, received criticism for being inconsistent and lacking transparency.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another major issue that Goodell has had to address during his tenure is the problem of concussion-induced brain damage in NFL players. The league has faced numerous lawsuits from retired players who claim that the NFL did not adequately communicate the risks of concussions. In 2013, the NFL reached a settlement with these players, agreeing to pay $765 million over 20 years to cover medical expenses and compensation.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Under Goodell's leadership, the NFL has implemented rule changes aimed at reducing on-field concussions. These include stricter penalties for hits to the head and neck and new protocols for diagnosing and treating concussions during games. While these changes have been criticized by some players and fans for making the game less exciting, they have been seen as necessary steps to protect the health and safety of the players.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite these challenges, Goodell has overseen a period of unprecedented growth for the NFL. The league's total revenue has nearly doubled over the past decade to $12.4 billion in 2015, and Goodell aims to achieve $25 billion in gross revenue by 2027. This growth has been fueled by lucrative television deals, a massive online presence, and the NFL's ability to capture the attention of American viewers like no other sport.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Goodell's leadership has not been without controversy, however. In 2015, he was criticized for his handling of the "Deflategate" scandal involving the New England Patriots and quarterback Tom Brady. Goodell suspended Brady for four games, but the suspension was overturned by a federal judge who criticized Goodell's handling of the case.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>while Roger Goodell has never played football himself, his extensive experience in the NFL has given him a deep understanding of the sport and its players. He has faced numerous challenges during his tenure as commissioner, including player misconduct and concussion-induced brain damage, but has overseen a period of unprecedented growth for the league. Goodell's leadership has not been without controversy, but his ability to keep the NFL on offense and capture the attention of American viewers has made him one of the most powerful figures in sports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hmKxloqS0pr6MoKaonJWhuW6x1Z6pZqiclsamsIyfpqiskpa5rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josef-schutz.html><span>←</span><span>Former Nazi Guard Josef Schtz Convicted In German Court</span></a>
