Fast forward to today, and <a href=#>Sony</a> is finally gearing up for the launch of the <a href=#>PSVR 2</a>. The headset officially launches on Feb. 22, but when will the PSVR 2 ship if you ordered it online? Here’s what you need to know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">When will PSVR 2 ship?</h2><p>As was the case with the PS5, finding a PSVR 2 in a brick-and-mortar store probably isn’t going to be easy. Fans have been itching for a follow-up to PSVR for years, and there’s a good chance inventory will sell out fast. This means a large portion of shoppers probably bought their headset online – but instead of dealing with crowds and driving to multiple stores, they now have to deal with the hazards of shipping and handling.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Guerrilla Games</span></figure><p>Thankfully, Sony is being remarkably transparent about when PSVR 2 headsets are shipping. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Isabelle Tomatis</a>, vice president at Sony, said that “orders from direct.playstation.com for PlayStation VR2 headsets and bundles will ship throughout the week of launch.”</p><p>Keep in mind shipping times will vary based on your location, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most users</a> are finding that their shipment is expected to arrive between Feb. 22 and Feb. 28. Others are even noting that the process might be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">slower than expected</a>, as they had trouble with their PS5 order through PlayStation – which arrived several days after launch.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-cbeQSR faRvJV"></figure><p>In other words, it might be best to set your expectations on a Feb. 28 arrival date. It’s unclear if different products will have different ship dates (PSVR 2 is being sold as a standalone product or as part of a Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle), but most gamers with a preorder seem to have shipping dates that fall within the same range mentioned above.</p><p>Remember – this is for orders directly from PlayStation. If you preordered PSVR 2 from a third-party retailer, then your PSVR 2 ship date might vary. Also, note that PSVR 2 purchases will require a signature for delivery. The headset isn’t cheap, so it makes sense Sony wouldn’t want it sitting out on your porch while you’re out of town.</p><p>PSVR 2 will have more than 20 titles available at launch, with dozens more planned for the months ahead. You’ll need a PS5 in order to use it, as the new-gen hardware doesn’t offer support for the PS4. And just like the PS5, the PSVR 2 is an expensive beast – clocking in at a staggering $550.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoywoKWkXaXAt76Ma2SsoJml</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-it-mean-that-gods-grace-is-sufficient-2-corinthians-129.html><span>←</span><span>What does it mean that Gods grace is sufficient (2 Corinthians 12:9)?</span></a>
