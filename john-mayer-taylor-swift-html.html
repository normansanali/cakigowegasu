It has been an interesting week for a couple of Taylor Swift’s famous ex-boyfriends. In the wake of the release of Swift’s new album Red (Taylor’s Version) — including new versions of songs believed to be about Swift’s relationship with the Donnie Darko star — Swifties are roasting Jake Gyllenhaal alive on social media."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In the wake of the release of Swift’s new album Red (Taylor’s Version) — including new versions of songs believed to be about Swift’s relationship with the Donnie Darko star — Swifties are <a href=#>roasting Jake Gyllenhaal</a> alive on social media. But while none of the songs on the album are believed to be about him, apparently the Swifties’ renewed anger toward Gyllenhaal has spilled out onto another of Swift’s exes — singer/songwriter John Mayer. Unlike what we know so far about all the Gyllenhaal hate, Mayer is actually getting death threats.</p><p>Like all the tweets and other posts about Gyllenhaal, many of the various memes and other anti-John-Mayer stuff going up online is harmless. However, as reported by <a href=#>BuzzFeed</a>, Mayer has reportedly received a lot of death threats, including one from a fan identifying herself as Alondra. She DMed Mayer on Instagram, and the singer actually responded to her. The story seems to have a happy ending in this case, as Mayer’s confrontation convinces Alondra to apologize. BuzzFeed says that she included an audio message, explaining that she had sent the DM on a dare. She initially shared the screenshots of the conversation before turning her post private. Of course, plenty of screenshots were taken before then. You can see the screenshots of the conversation below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/john-mayer-threat.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/john-mayer-02.jpeg><p>As BuzzFeed recalls, in 2009 John Mayer and Taylor Swift dated — when Mayer was 32 and Swift was 19. The following year, after their split, Swift released Speak Now which included the song “Dear John.” Widely believed to be about her relationship with Mayer, “Dear John” directly references their age gap and claims the subject of the song subjected her to “dark, twisted” emotional abuse. In an interview with <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, Mayer criticized Swift for releasing the song without warning him first, saying he was humiliated by it. Three years after “Dear John” came Mayer’s “Paper Doll” on his album Paradise Valley, which many have interpreted to be his answer to Swift.</p><p>Swifties all over were apparently reminded of the drama between John Mayer and Tay-Tay with the release of a 10-minute version of “All Too Well.” Swift has <a href=#>promoted the song hard</a>, performing it on Saturday Night Live and even producing a short film to go along with it, starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O’Brien. Along with other new material in the song, there are some savage disses at Gyllenhaal’s expense, particularly a line highlighting their age gap (she was 20 and he was 29): “And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes/ ‘I’ll get older, but your lovers stay my age.'” Currently 40 years old, Gyllenhaal <a href=#>is dating</a> model Jeanne Cadieu, who is 25.</p><p>Taylor Swift hasn’t commented on the heat being felt by either Gyllenhaal or John Mayer, and if her fans are to be believed, she doesn’t seem to be letting up on promoting songs about them. Earlier this week she released the <a href=#>lighthearted video</a> for “I Bet You Think About Me,” which many fans also suspect is about Gyllenhaal. Swift plays a woman dressed all in red at the wedding reception of her ex, who assumes different roles to cause all kinds of mischief.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnmqS1r3nMmrCeql2prrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8FvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-did-hunter-schafer-get-cast-euphoria.html><span>←</span><span>How Did Hunter Schafer Get Cast In 'Euphoria'?</span></a>
