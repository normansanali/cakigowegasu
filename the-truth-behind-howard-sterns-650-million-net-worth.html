He decided the world needed his wise words on paper. In 1993 he teamed up with Simon & Schuster with the idea of writing a book. The autobiography, called Private Parts, gave Howard another million in the bank and ended up being adapted into a major motion picture. The book sold <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">half a million copies</a> in its first month. Selling the rights to the book, which went to Paramount Pictures, meant even more cash for Howard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A second book entitled 'Miss America' was released to the public in 1995, and Stern received a three million dollar advance from ReganBooks.
