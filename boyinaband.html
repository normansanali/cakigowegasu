Over time, he released a series of follow-up videos to “Don’t Stay in School”.</p><p>Likewise, his final follow-up video, “You don’t legally have to go to school”, discusses various unconventional educational options: alternative schools, charter schools, “unschooling”, and homeschooling.</p><p>Moreover, in the video, David Brown also interviews a student from one of these progressive schools.</p><h4><span>More About Career…</span></h4><p>In the year 2015, David published a song featuring fellow YouTubers Cryaotic and Minx focusing on LGBT issues and voicing his support for the community in collaboration with the UK-based LGBT charity somewhereto_.</p><p>Then, in the year 2017, he collaborated with iDubbbz to create a diss track against RiceGum titled “Asian Jake Paul” as part of iDubbbz’s Content Cop series.</p><p>On 31 March 2019, David Brown collaborated with PewDiePie and RoomieOfficial in an upbeat rap/synthpop/hip-hop music video titled “Congratulations”.</p><p>This music video was based on sarcastically congratulating T-Series for surpassing PewDiePie in subscribers, while also bringing up the corporation’s past scandals and criticizing the Caste system in India.</p><p>David’s work spans various genres including electronic, hip-hop, and heavy metal as a producer, vocalist, rapper, songwriter, DJ, and instrumentalist.</p><p>And, among other endeavors his former electronicore band You and What Army, had various successes playing Download Festival and Sonisphere Festival.</p><p>Moreover, the band was put on hiatus in the year 2014. Other video content includes vlogs, music tutorials, education, comedy skits, raps, and challenges.</p><h4><span>YouTube and More…</span></h4><p>In the year 2015, his YouTube channel started becoming less active due to personal issues with depression and a lack of motivation.</p><p>Then, on July 9, David made a video discussing why he hasn’t been uploading or tweeting for a while. He uploaded one other video unrelated to the subject but then took a year to upload it again.</p><p>And, on August 10, 2016, he uploaded the video “I’m not Dead.”, which was a song about his problems. He then stuck to his regular upload schedule after this until October 2017.</p><p>On April 21, 2018, David Brown posted his first video in nearly six months called “My New Look.”.</p><p>This semi-update semi-comedic video revealed that he had grown his facial hair out and dyed half of the goatee red to match up with his hair to create a new look.</p><p>Likewise, on May 3rd of the same year, he shaved and revealed why he hadn’t been uploading.
