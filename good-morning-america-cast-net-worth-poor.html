However, over the last several years, 'Good Morning America' has taken the top spot. Something that they continued to do into the first part of 2024. The latest stats show that 'GMA' has an average of 77,000 viewers more than 'Today'. The better the show, the more money there is to be distributed to the talent, of course. As such, it would not be surprising for the cast of 'Good Morning America' to have their net worths grow if this trend continues.</p><h2 id=ginger-zee><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ginger Zee</span></h2><h3 id=net-worth-2-5-million>Net Worth: $2.5 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/untitled-design-4-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Zee's salary is $500,000</strong></li></ul><p>First up on the list is Ginger Zee.
