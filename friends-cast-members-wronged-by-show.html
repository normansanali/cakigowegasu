Bonnie then jokily asked that fans support the 'exes' of the show, saying: "So today I ask you to band together to honour the exes of Friends." Bonnie previously opened up about her role in the show, saying: "My agent said, 'They're casting episode one and there's a small role that has maybe a couple of lines.' I went in and [series creators] Marta [Kaufman] and David [Crane] were in the room, and it was over in a second. Then my agent called and said, 'You got in, you're going in to work on Monday.'"</p><p id=eYGi4ssNw-U_ data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Friends is hitting the big screen for 25th anniversary</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
