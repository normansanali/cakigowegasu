Definitely not.”</p><p>Caleb, 79, is a six-time Academy Award nominee, best known for his work on movies like <i>The Natural</i>, <i>Fly Away Home</i>,<i> The Patriot</i>, <i>The Passion of the Christ</i> and 2019’s <i>The Lion King</i>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mary Jo, 78, is best known for her role on <i>Twin Peaks</i> while also appearing in movies like <i>The Right Stuff</i>, <i>My Sister’s Keeper</i> and <i>Ruby Sparks</i>.</p><p>While rejecting the nepo baby moniker — a distinction given to privileged individuals with famous parents, most usually used to define actors and other performers — Zooey was quick to acknowledge how fortunate she’s been in other ways.</p><p>She said, “I can’t possibly emphasize enough how much creative help I had from my family unit.”</p><p>“My dad is a great creative mind and such a talented person,” she continued. “Like, knows everything about film. My mom is a great actor and is so nurturing. My mom would coach me when I didn’t have an acting coach; She would help me, read lines with me. She’d be so supportive.”</p><p>Zooey explained that having artistic parents “just automatically makes you have community.”</p><p>The actress earned her first acting credit with a guest appearance on the <strong>Kirstie Alley</strong>–starring NBC sitcom <i>Veronica’s Closet</i> in 1998 and made her film debut in 1999’s <i>Mumford</i>, written and directed by <strong>Lawrence Kasdan</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Recently, actress <strong>Dakota Johnson</strong> — whose parents are <strong>Melanie Griffith</strong> and <strong>Don Johnson</strong> — poked fun at being called a nepo baby during her January 27 <i>Saturday Night Live</i> hosting gig.</p><p>During <a href=#>a sketch featuring Please Don’t Destroy</a>, Dakota entered into a “nepo truce” with group members <strong>John Higgins</strong> and <strong>Martin Herlihy</strong>, whose fathers are<i> SNL</i> producer <strong>Steve Higgins</strong> and former <i>SNL</i> writer <strong>Tim Herlihy</strong>, respectively.</p><p>“When that first started I found it to be incredibly annoying and boring,” Dakota, 34, <a href=#>later said</a> on the February 8 episode of the <i>Today</i> show. “If you’re a journalist, write about something else. That’s just lame. So the opportunity to make fun of it, I jumped at.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGazp5%2Baxm6wxKyaoZmemrluv8CyqmarmJrAbrrEr5yrZZekwbWxzWahqJqjYq%2Bmr8Cuqp5ln5t6qbHRZp2apZ%2BqwG6wwJ1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./760745-yung-miami-yams-era-trailer-hip-hop-news.html><span>←</span><span>Yung Miami Reveals &amp;quot;Yams&amp;quot; Era Trailer And The Fans Are Ready For It</span></a>
