Richard Roberts, 48, Zachery Shipman, 25, and Allen Todd, 23 are also facing third-degree assault charges.</p><p>The melee, where sides broke down along racial lines, began Saturday evening when a moored pontoon boat blocked the Harriott II riverboat from docking in its designated space along the city’s riverfront.</p><p>The riverboat co-captain took another vessel to shore to attempt to move the pontoon boat and was attacked by several white people from the private boat, police said.

At least one person was knocked into the water.</p><p>The three white boaters are so far the only people charged. Police have said more charges are likely as they continue to review video footage of the fight.</p><p>Video of the brawl circulated on social media and put a national spotlight on Alabama’s capital city.</p><p>“It was just absolutely unnecessary and uncalled for,” Alabama Gov.
