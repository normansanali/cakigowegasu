The photos captured her wearing sunglasses, a baseball cap, and a green jacket. She seemed afraid, trying to avoid the paparazzo’s camera lens as she walked down Fifth Avenue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>While Kendall Jenner has denied undergoing any plastic surgery, </strong>there’s been noticeable changes in her appearance since 2016. Some speculate she might have had fillers or Botox injections to smooth out lines around her eyes and forehead.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.the-sun.com/lifestyle/5822077/kendall-jenner-plastic-surgey-nose-job-cheeks/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sun</a>, She denied that she’d had any plastic surgery.</p><p><strong>“It’s all so exhausting. As a model, why would I have my face reconstructed? It doesn’t even make</strong> <strong>sense,”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Kendall Jenner was among the early celebrities to undergo a nose job, known as rhinoplasty. This procedure is quite common in plastic surgery. She had her nose job in 2015 when she was 20 years old, but she’s mentioned wanting the surgery since her high school days.&nbsp;</p><p>And when talking about her lip surgery, she had lip injections when she was quite young, and over the years, her lips have gotten bigger through multiple injections.&nbsp;Also, Kendall Jenner’s high brow has caught many people’s attention. Some wonder if she had an eyebrow lift or filler injections to achieve this look.&nbsp;</p><p>Kendall Jenner’s eye lift is a surgical procedure aimed at lifting the upper eyelid. It’s performed by an <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000781.htm rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">oculoplastic</a> surgeon who specializes in such procedures.</p><p><strong>There have been rumors that Kendall Jenner had a Botox treatment</strong>, which isn’t surprising considering her consistently youthful appearance without signs of aging. Her smooth face has led some to speculate that she may have used Botox injections on her forehead at some point.&nbsp;</p><p>While genetics and skincare routines could play a role in Kendall’s youthful appearance, it’s worth noting that her sisters, who share similar genes and lifestyles, haven’t achieved the same results. This suggests that factors like genetics or skincare alone might not fully explain Kendall’s youthful look, potentially leaving room for speculation about other interventions like Botox.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-center has-very-light-gray-to-cyan-bluish-gray-gradient-background has-background"><strong><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://celebtransformations.com/bradley-cooper-plastic-surgery/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Bradley Cooper Plastic Surgery: His Before and After Transformation</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Summary</h2><p>Kendall Jenner, an American model, media personality, and businesswoman, gained fame through the TV show.
