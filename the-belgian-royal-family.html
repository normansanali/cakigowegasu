At one point it was ruled by the Dutch monarch William of Orange, but the current royal family - the House of Wettin -came to power in 1830 after religious differences and unpopular economic reforms provoked a revolution.</p><p id=e7gGxRL4hQBvo data-wc=150>With its newfound independence, the country took pride in its neutrality, but things were to change dramatically in 1914 when German troops breached Belgian borders to invade France. Despite a valiant struggle by its armed forces, the nation fell to the invaders and the monarch at the time, King Albert, was forced to flee with his government to Le Havre in France. They remained there until the conflict ended in 1918.Two decades later the war clouds once again gathered across Europe and Brussels fell to the Nazis in 1940. This time the government-in-exile was established in London, although Leopold III, who had ascended to the throne upon the death of Albert in 1934, remained in Brussels for the duration of the war. His decision to do so was not well-received by his ministers who, when they regained control in 1951, forced him to abdicate in favour of his son, Baudouin.</p><p id=e7lkIcQatN9SN data-wc=81>The new king and his wife Queen Fabiola remained childless, and when - on July 31, 1993 - Baudouin's 42-year-rule came to an end, there were doubts over who would follow him. His young nephew Philippe was expected to accede to the throne, but with the problems arising from the country's linguistic and religious differences, it was decided a more experienced hand was called for. In the end Baudouin's crown passed to his brother, Albert, who remains sovereign to this day.</p><p id=erlQ9qsEUrG data-wc=9>The official royal website can be found at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>http://www.monarchie.be/</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
