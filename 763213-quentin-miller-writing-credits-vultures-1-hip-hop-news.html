Amid the Toronto rapper’s feud with Meek Mill, Meek outed Miller as Drake’s ghostwriter. Last year, Miller reflected on that period of his career and revealed he wasn’t properly paid for working on Drake’s 2015 mixtape If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late. “I never got a single publishing check off any songs,” he told VladTV. “I had to feed my family off getting paid under the table in that situation, because Tricky and them wouldn’t let me go, I didn’t get out that deal ’til 2019, 2020; I signed [it in] 2011, I had to let go of a lot of shit just to get out. Even while I was in it, I never got a publishing check or nothing. I was just grinding, bro. I was grinding it out just hoping that one day that one song or working with that one artist is gonna change something — and that was the Drake thing! But it just didn’t change anything.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-quentin-miller-reflects-on-working-with-kanye-west>Quentin Miller Reflects On Working With Kanye West</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition to Drake and Kanye, Miller has worked with a number of other stars in hip-hop over the years including <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Big Sean</a>, Travis Scott, and more.
