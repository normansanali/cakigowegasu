The album was a massive hit for the singer. The song, "I Wanna Love You Forever" ranked number three on the billboard charts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simpson also became known for her relationship and marriage to Nick Lachey, of the boy band 98 Degrees. They became one of the most high-profile couples of the early 2000s. Jessica also spoke about waiting until marriage to have sex. Jessica wrote in her 2020 memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Open Book"</a>, "Nick was meant to be my husband. No one else was supposed to have my virginity."</p><p>The couple soon had their own reality show, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica, which lasted for three seasons. After three years of marriage, the couple announced they were divorcing.</p><p>Over the years, Jessica Simpson has frequently been a source for gossip.

So, when the couple was having problems, the press was all over them. There were rumors that an affair with her Dukes of Hazzard co-star Johnny Knoxville contributed to the end of her marriage. The two denied an inappropriate relationship at the time, but Jessica later wrote in her memoir that she and Knoxville had an "emotional affair".</p><p>Simpson wrote, “To me, an emotional affair was worse than a physical one. It’s funny, I know, because I had placed such an emphasis on sex by not having it before marriage. After I actually had sex, I understood that the emotional part was what mattered. And Johnny and I had that.”</p><p>It was soon after reports of the affair that the Jessica and Nick ended their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-obsession-with-jessica-simpson-39-s-weight><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Obsession With Jessica Simpson's Weight</span></h2><p>There are many celebrities whose weight is talked about in the press, but Simpson's is almost constant. Like many, her weight fluctuates, but Jessica is constantly scrutinized for it.</p><p>In April 2022, Simpson announced that she had lost 100 pounds. She posted a pic of herself in a bikini with the caption, “I have gained and lost 100lbs 3x so I never thought this moment could or would happen, but I’m finally spring breakin’ wearin’ a BIKINI!!!!!!” the caption continued, “Hard work, determination, self-love, I enjoyed a good proud cry today.”</p><p>She revealed in a Today Show interview that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she "threw out" her scale.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also talks about being body-shamed in 2009. A photo of her onstage wearing high-waisted jeans and a tank top went viral when haters criticized her look and her body. She told Hoda Kotb that the comments "broke her heart".</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Forgot All About That Time Eva Longoria Was In Jessica Simpson's Music Video</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-between-jessica-simpson-and-john-mayer><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>What Happened Between Jessica Simpson And John Mayer?</span></h2><p>Another huge story was <a href=#>what went down between Jessica Simpson and John Mayer</a>.</p><p>Mayer has been linked to many celebrities including<strong><a href=#> Taylor Swift, </a></strong>Jennifer Aniston, and Katy Perry. But in 2010, he spoke about Simpson in an interview with Playboy Magazine. “That girl is like crack cocaine to me. Sexually it was crazy. That's all I'll say. It was like napalm, sexual napalm." He continued, “Did you ever say, 'I want to quit my life and just f**king snort you? If you charged me $10,000 to f**k you, I would start selling all my s**t just to keep f**king you.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simpson spoke to Oprah Winfrey about the interview and said that Mayer called her to apologize, but she did not accept. She said, "I don't resent him. I'm just going to let that go. That part of my life is over."</p><p>Years later, in 2021 she told Tamron Hall, "I don't resent him. I'm just going to let that go. That part of my life is over."</p><h2 id=jessica-simpson-39-s-happily-ever-after><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jessica Simpson's Happily Ever After</span></h2><p>Jessica Simpson has had her fair share of relationship issues. But that changed when she met Eric Johnson. She has been married to the former football player since 2014. The couple met in 2010 and Johnson proposed after six months of dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnson was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in 2001 but missed most of the 2003 and 2005 seasons due to injuries.

"Respectfully…she looks frail," and "Is she ok?" were just some comments.</p><p>Others came to Simpson's defense, "It’s sad that all these comments are about her appearance. It’s none of anyone’s business. I wish people were kinder," and "Adorable room. Ignore the haters."</p><h2 id=jessica-simpson-responds-to-comments-about-her-appearance><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jessica Simpson Responds To Comments About Her Appearance</span></h2><p>Jessica Simpson took to Instagram to address the negative comments, "As much as I have learned to block out destructive noise…peoples’ comments and judgments can still hurt deeply with their incessant nagging 'you will never be good enough.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also said, "A little advice…live inside your dreams and move through them. Don’t give up on yourself because someone else did. Stay true to YOU. It has worked for me in this chaotic life thus far. Nothin’ and nobody will rob me of my joy. Ya might come close but it is mine to own. Yours should be too."</p><p>In the same post, she revealed that she has been sober for five years, "The most important thing I have learned through the last 5yrs without alcohol being a guard for escapism, is that I CAN and ALWAYS WILL get through it. I am capable of pretty much anything I care enough about to put my mind to. I am present. I am deeply inspired. I am determined. I am honest. I care about other people."</p><h2 id=jessica-simpson-39-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jessica Simpson's Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessica Simpson has become so much more than a singer. Those who counted her out for being a "dumb blonde" on her reality show were quite incorrect. <a href=#>She now has a net worth of over $200 million</a>.</p><p>Her fortune began as a singer and actress, but she is also a retail entrepreneur with a line of beauty products, handbags, lingerie, shoes and boots. Plus, she had a multi-million dollar deal with Weight Watchers, and she is a best-selling author.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jessica Simpson's Branding-Gone-Bad Experience Hints At A Bigger Problem In The Fashion Industry</a></span></p><h2 id=nick-lachey-throws-shade-at-jessica-simpson><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Nick Lachey Throws Shade At Jessica Simpson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nick and his current wife, Vanessa Lachey, host the successful <strong><a href=#>Netflix </a></strong>series, <a href=#>Love is Blind</a>.
