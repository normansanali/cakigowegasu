Gregory was allowed to abdicate, and Henry installed one of his pet bishops as Clement II. Benedict fled this episode of <i>Game of Thrones</i> and arranged to poison Clement, after which he reclaimed the papacy.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-41641 alt="Benedict IX Dead Pope" width=800 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/benedict-ix-dead-pope1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-41641 class=wp-caption-text>WW—oh, forget it.<br>Source: <a href=#>Sentry Medical Group</a></p><p>Enough was enough, even for Rome. By this point, Henry was firmly embedded in the politics of the papacy, and when he heard about the shenanigans he sent a new pope, Damasus II, with an army to back him up. Unfortunately for Henry, Damasus died of malaria after 24 days. Fortunately for Henry, Germany still had plenty of bishops to toss at Italy, so Leo IX—who was evidently immune to malaria, poison, and mysterious falls down flights of stairs—finally took charge and dispatched Benedict to a monastery, where he conveniently repented of his ways and died of totally natural causes at the age of 35.</p><p>As it happens, Leo IX would later be canonized as a saint, though it may be argued that anybody would qualify for sainthood after the disaster area that was Benedict’s reign(s). Surprisingly, the Catholic Church currently recognizes Benedict as the legitimate pope of his age, as popes can’t officially be deposed or impeached. So that means that all of the other claimants, including the one who paid good money for the gig, were illegitimate antipopes. Officially, Leo IX was legit, since Benedict IX “resigned” prior to his murder. That reasoning sounds a bit thin, but you get the impression everybody is happy to just let that sleeping dog lie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyjsc2em6KbpGK2uXuR</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amy-grant-net-worthhusbandage.html><span>←</span><span>Amy Grant Net Worth, Husband, Age, Greatest Hits</span></a>
